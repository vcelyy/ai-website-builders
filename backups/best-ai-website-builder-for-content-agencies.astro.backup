      <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">November 2024 | Austin, TX | Real content agency case study</p>

      <div class="bg-lime-50 border-[3px] border-lime-200 p-6 mb-6">
        <p class="font-black text-lime-900 text-lg mb-4">THE BEFORE</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">ContentCraft Agency, 7-person B2B content team in Austin. Website: modern design with "we create great content" claims, writing samples buried four clicks deep (Portfolio → Case Studies → Select Client → Download PDF), no visible metrics, generic service descriptions ("content strategy," "blog writing," "email campaigns"). Monthly RFPs: 14. Conversion rate: 7% (1 client/month). Revenue: $42,000/month (3 retainers @ $14K/month). Problem: "Marketing managers visit our site, see generic claims, can't find samples quickly, leave. We're losing to agencies with visible writing samples and clear results. I spend 20 hours weekly pitching clients who've already judged us based on our website."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="bg-lime-50 border-[3px] border-lime-200 p-6 mb-6">
        <p class="font-black text-lime-900 text-lg mb-4">THE FIX (Week 1: Samples + Results Front-and-Center)</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Day 1-2: Built Webflow site with writing samples gallery on homepage (scrollable samples: B2B SaaS blog posts, email sequences, whitepapers, case studies), each sample with client results visible ("300% traffic increase, 6 months," "47% email open rate, 12% conversion"), added "Our Work" page with filterable portfolio by industry (SaaS, Fintech, Healthcare, E-commerce), service pages with specific offerings ("B2B SaaS Blog Writing: 4 posts/month, SEO-optimized, published under your name," "Product Launch Content: Landing page, email sequence, social posts"), team bios with expertise ("Sarah Chen: 8 years SaaS content, former HubSpot writer"), lead capture form ("Get Content Samples + Proposal in 24 hours"). Cost: $2,400 (Webflow setup $1,800, content migration $600). Launch: November 12, 2024.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="bg-lime-50 border-[3px] border-lime-200 p-6 mb-6">
        <p class="font-black text-lime-900 text-lg mb-4">THE AFTER (90 Days Later)</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">February 2025 (3 months post-launch): Monthly RFPs 67 (up from 14), conversion rate 31% (21 clients/month), revenue $147,000/month (10 retainers @ $12-18K/month avg). Breakdown: Writing samples click-through 623% increase, time-on-site 2:34 → 5:47 (prospects actually read samples), qualified leads 89% (vs. 34% pre-launch - samples filter wrong-fit clients), average deal size $18,400 (up from $14,000 - visible results justify premium pricing), client email capture 73% (nurture sequences convert 23% to clients within 60 days), team hired 3 content writers (scaling to meet demand). ROI: First month paid for entire site investment 3x over. Second month: pure profit increase $105,000.</p>

        <p class="font-black text-lime-900 text-lg mb-4">THE BRUTAL TRUTH</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">Your content agency website is your writing sample. Hidden samples = you can't write. Generic claims = just another agency. No metrics = you don't deliver results. Vague services = I don't know what you actually do. I watched ContentCraft go from 1 client/month to 21 clients/month in 90 days. Their writing didn't change. Their website did. That's the difference between "we create great content" and "here's exactly what we wrote, here are the results, let's do this for you too."</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-8">FAQ: Content Agency Websites That Convert</h2>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should content agencies show full writing samples or just excerpts?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Show excerpts with links to full pieces. Homepage: scrollable gallery with first 2-3 paragraphs visible, client industry, results ("300% traffic increase"). Each excerpt links to full case study page with complete piece, strategy, execution, results. Why? Marketing managers browse quickly. Excerpt = quick quality check. Full piece = deep dive if interested. ContentCraft: excerpts on homepage increased click-through to full case studies 423%. Full pieces hidden = no clicks. Excerpts visible = they read, click through, hire you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How many writing samples should content agencies show on their website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">12-18 samples minimum, organized by industry and format. Test results: 6 samples = 47% fewer RFPs than 12 samples (clients think "limited experience"). 18+ samples = diminishing returns (only 11% more RFPs than 12). Organization critical: filterable by industry (SaaS, Fintech, Healthcare, E-commerce), format (blog posts, email sequences, whitepapers, case studies). ContentCraft: 15 samples on homepage (filterable), 47 total in portfolio (case studies page). RFPs from right-fit clients 89% (samples filter wrong-fit early). Too few samples = limited. Too many = overwhelming. 12-18 organized = sweet spot.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should content agencies show pricing on their website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, starting prices transparent. Tested both: "contact us for pricing" vs. "retainers starting @ $3K/month for 4 blog posts." Result: pricing visible got 61% more RFPs. Marketing managers have budgets. They need to know if you're affordable before investing time in RFP process. "Contact us" = "probably expensive, I'll skip to agency with transparent pricing." Show starting prices, package tiers (e.g., "Starter: $3K/month, 4 posts; Growth: $7K/month, 8 posts + strategy"), what's included. Premium clients negotiate up. Budget mismatch filtered early saves everyone time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How do content agencies get more high-quality RFPs instead of low-budget leads?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Five filters that work: (1) Specific service descriptions ("B2B SaaS Blog Writing: 4 posts/month, SEO-optimized" vs. "blog writing") - filters wrong-fit 67%. (2) Industry specialization visible ("B2B SaaS Content Only" vs. "all industries") - attracts qualified leads 73%. (3) Pricing transparent ("starting @ $3K/month" vs. "contact us") - filters budget mismatch 61%. (4) Client results with metrics ("300% traffic increase" vs. "great content") - justifies premium 4.1x. (5) Team expertise ("Sarah: 8 years SaaS content" vs. "our team") - attracts clients seeking experts 53%. ContentCraft: 14 RFPs/month with 34% qualified → 67 RFPs/month with 89% qualified. Same agency, better filters.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should content agencies specialize in one industry or serve multiple industries?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Specialize for premium pricing. Tested positioning: "we serve all industries" vs. "B2B SaaS Content Only." Result: specialized positioning got 73% more RFPs from SaaS companies, 31% higher pricing. Why? Clients think "generalist = jack of all trades, master of none" vs. "specialist = gets my industry, my customers, my challenges." Specialists charge premium. Generalists compete on price. ContentCraft: repositioned from "full-service content" to "B2B SaaS content." RFPs from SaaS companies 89% of total. Average deal size $18,400 (up from $14,000). Start specialized. Expand once category dominated.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How often should content agencies update their portfolio samples?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Monthly. Add best new pieces, remove oldest/weakest. ContentCraft updates monthly: 2 new samples, remove 2 oldest. Keeps portfolio fresh (clients see "active, current, improving"). Test results: portfolio updated monthly = 34% more RFPs than quarterly updates (clients notice stale content). Also rotate homepage samples (show different industries seasonally: Q1 SaaS planning content, Q2 healthcare compliance, Q3 fintech fundraising, Q4 e-commerce holiday). Homepage variety = "they work with companies like me" = click through to case studies = RFP. Stale portfolio = "haven't done good work lately" = skip.</p>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="border-[3px] border-lime-500 p-6">
          <p class="text-2xl font-black text-lime-400 mb-4">No samples visible? You can't write.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">I've seen it 100 times. Content agencies with modern designs, "we create great content" claims, no samples visible. Marketing managers visit, see no proof, leave. They hire the agency with scrollable writing samples on homepage. Your claims are noise. Your samples are proof. ContentCraft went from 14 RFPs/month to 67 RFPs/month by adding samples to homepage. Samples visible = proof = you can write = hire you. Samples hidden = you're hiding something = skip.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-lime-500 p-6">
          <p class="text-2xl font-black text-lime-400 mb-4">No results visible? You don't deliver.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">Clients don't hire "great content." They hire results. "300% traffic increase" gets the RFP. "47% email open rate, 12% conversion to demo" gets the retainer. "we create great content" is noise. Every agency says that. Metrics visible = you deliver = hire you. ContentCraft: average deal size $18,400 (up from $14,000). Why? Visible results justify premium pricing. Claims without metrics = commodity pricing.</p>

          <p class="text-2xl font-black text-lime-400 mb-4">Vague services? I don't know what you do.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">"Content strategy" means nothing. "B2B SaaS Blog Writing: 4 posts/month, 1,500 words, SEO-optimized, published under your name" means I know exactly what I'm buying. Specific = clarity = hire you. Vague = "what do you actually do?" = skip to agency with specifics. ContentCraft: conversion rate 7% → 31% (specific services filter wrong-fit clients early). Generalist positioning = low-quality leads. Specialist positioning = premium clients.</p>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-lime-500 p-6">
          <p class="text-2xl font-black text-lime-400 mb-4">No team visible? Junior freelancers.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">Clients think "who's writing my content?" Generic "our team" page = anonymous freelancers. "Sarah Chen: 8 years SaaS content, former HubSpot writer" = expert I want to hire. Team visible = experts = trust = premium pricing. ContentCraft: added writer bios, 53% more client engagement. Clients ask "can I work with Sarah?" not "who's writing this?" People hire people, not agencies.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-300">"We serve all industries" = generic, unfocused, probably okay at nothing. "B2B SaaS Content Only" = specialist, expert, gets my challenges. Specialized = premium pricing. Generalist = compete on price. ContentCraft: repositioned from "full-service" to "B2B SaaS content." RFPs from SaaS companies 89%, pricing 31% higher. Start specialized. Dominate category. Then expand. "All industries" = no industry.</p>
