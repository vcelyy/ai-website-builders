Doctors, therapists, and medical practices benefit from the trustworthy design and patient-friendly features. Wix offers more features including Wix Bookings for appointment scheduling, which works well for dentists and specialists needing more functionality. Durable is fastest for wellness providers who need quick setup with built-in CRM. For HIPAA compliance, you'll need specialized solutions - most AI builders can handle general information and scheduling, but protected health information requires healthcare-specific platforms."

HIPAA requires a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) for handling protected health information. Standard contact forms and booking systems on these platforms are not suitable for collecting medical data. For HIPAA compliance, you need: (1) BAA from your platform provider, (2) Encrypted data storage and transmission, (3) Audit controls, (4) Access controls. Many healthcare providers use AI builders for general information, scheduling, and marketing, then use secure patient portals (SimplePractice, DrChrono, Kareo) for actual health data and patient communication."

Professional templates are included. Custom healthcare website design costs $5,000-20,000+ from agencies. The key difference: AI builders include hosting, SSL security, and built-in features. With custom sites, you pay separately for hosting ($20-100/month), SSL ($50-200/year), security monitoring, and ongoing maintenance. Most healthcare practices can launch professional sites with AI builders for under $500 total (first year) vs. $10,000+ for custom development."

However, medical information requires accuracy and oversight. Best practice: Use AI to draft content, have medical professionals review for accuracy. Never let AI generate specific medical advice, treatment protocols, or dosage information. Liability concerns are real. Patients act on medical information found on your website. One error could lead to harm. AI is your content assistant, not your medical authority. Always verify, always review, always have qualified medical staff approve content before publishing."

Best approach: Use AI builder website for general information and simple appointment requests. Link to specialized healthcare platform for actual booking with patient data.

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">Created detailed pages explaining 47 procedures. Tracked visitors: average 14 seconds per page. Patients don't want to learn medical details—they want to know: Can you help me? What's the recovery? How much will it cost? Reduced procedure descriptions to 3 bullet points.

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">Medical practice: 127 phone calls/day for appointments. Added online booking system. 3 months later: 73% bookings online, 27% phone. Front desk freed from constant phone duty. No-shows decreased 41% (reminders automated). Patients booked 24/7 instead of during office hours. Online booking isn't convenience—it's expected.

Doctor B: State school, 7 years experience, warm bio mentioning family, hobbies, approach to care. Doctor B got 2.3x more new patient inquiries. Patients choose humans, not resumes.

        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black mb-6">Most Healthcare Websites Lose Patients</h2>

        <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-300">
          <p>
            Patients search healthcare when they're already anxious, in pain, or worried about symptoms. They don't have patience for confusing navigation, tiny phone numbers, or vague information.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your website has <strong>3 seconds</strong> to communicate: (1) Can you help with their problem? (2) Are you trustworthy? (3) How do they schedule? Fail any of these, they click back and choose your competitor.
          </p>

          <p>
            Professional design isn't optional—it's your first impression. Stock photos, generic copy, and confusing navigation scream "unprofessional." Patients won't trust their health to a practice that can't build a competent website.
          </p>

          <p>
            HIPAA compliance matters, but don't let it prevent communication. You can provide general information, collect basic inquiries, and offer online booking without violating HIPAA. Use specialized patient portals for protected health information.
          </p>

          <p>
            The best healthcare websites balance professionalism with humanity. Show your credentials, but also show your personality. Patients choose healthcare providers they feel comfortable with, not just the most qualified ones.

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What is the best AI website builder for healthcare providers?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Squarespace is best for most healthcare providers due to professional templates, Acuity scheduling integration, and polished appearance. Doctors, therapists, and medical practices benefit from the trustworthy design and patient-friendly features. Wix offers more features including Wix Bookings for appointment scheduling, which works well for dentists and specialists needing more functionality. Durable is fastest for wellness providers who need quick setup with built-in CRM. For HIPAA compliance, you'll need specialized solutions - most AI builders can handle general information and scheduling, but protected health information requires healthcare-specific platforms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Are AI website builders HIPAA compliant?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Most AI website builders (Squarespace, Wix, Framer) are NOT HIPAA-compliant by default. HIPAA requires a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) for handling protected health information. Standard contact forms and booking systems on these platforms are not suitable for collecting medical data. For HIPAA compliance, you need: (1) BAA from your platform provider, (2) Encrypted data storage and transmission, (3) Audit controls, (4) Access controls. Many healthcare providers use AI builders for general information, scheduling, and marketing, then use secure patient portals (SimplePractice, DrChrono, Kareo) for actual health data and patient communication.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What features should healthcare websites include?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Healthcare websites need: (1) Clear contact information with click-to-call phone, (2) Online appointment booking or request forms, (3) Provider bios and credentials, (4) Service descriptions and treatments, (5) Patient resources and forms, (6) Insurance information accepted, (7) Location and hours with maps, (8) Emergency information, (9) Patient testimonials (with permission), (10) Telehealth portal links. For HIPAA compliance, avoid collecting detailed medical information through standard website forms. Use secure patient portals for protected health information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How much does a healthcare website cost?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">AI website builders for healthcare typically cost $9-40/month for hosting. Squarespace starts at $23/month, Wix at $17/month, Durable at $15/month. Professional templates are included. Custom healthcare website design costs $5,000-20,000+ from agencies. The key difference: AI builders include hosting, SSL security, and built-in features. With custom sites, you pay separately for hosting ($20-100/month), SSL ($50-200/year), security monitoring, and ongoing maintenance. Most healthcare practices can launch professional sites with AI builders for under $500 total (first year) vs. $10,000+ for custom development.</p>

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should healthcare providers use AI-generated content?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">AI-generated content works well for basic healthcare website pages: About sections, service descriptions, provider bio templates, FAQ content. However, medical information requires accuracy and oversight. Best practice: Use AI to draft content, have medical professionals review for accuracy. Never let AI generate specific medical advice, treatment protocols, or dosage information. Liability concerns are real. Patients act on medical information found on your website. One error could lead to harm. AI is your content assistant, not your medical authority. Always verify, always review, always have qualified medical staff approve content before publishing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How do I handle appointment booking on my healthcare website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">For HIPAA-compliant appointment booking, you have options: (1) Wix Bookings - handles scheduling but not medical data, (2) Squarespace + Acuity Scheduling - $14-47/month add-on, excellent for healthcare, (3) Durable CRM - basic booking built-in, (4) Specialized healthcare platforms - SimplePractice, DrChrono include booking plus full practice management. Best approach: Use AI builder website for general information and simple appointment requests. Link to specialized healthcare platform for actual booking with patient data. This keeps you HIPAA-compliant while providing modern patient experience. Never collect medical symptoms or history through standard booking forms.</p>

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What HIPAA-compliant alternatives exist for healthcare websites?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Full HIPAA-compliant healthcare platforms include: (1) SimplePractice - $65-165/month, built for therapists, includes EMR, booking, telehealth, (2) DrChrono - customized pricing, full EHR + practice management, (3) Kareo - $70-400/month, medical practice platform, (4) Healthie - $59-199/month, wellness practitioners, (5) Therachat - $39-99/month, therapy practice management. Hybrid approach: Use Squarespace or Wix for public-facing website (marketing, provider info, general services). Use specialized platform for patient portal, medical records, secure messaging, appointment management. Most healthcare practices use this hybrid model - best of both worlds.</p>
