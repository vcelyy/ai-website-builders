          It was 2 AM on a Tuesday. I'd been on Zoom calls for 8 hours, staring at a blank Figma canvas, watching the cursor blink at me like it was judging my life choices.

          The client email was still open in another tab:

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I should've said yes. $8,000 for a landing page is good money. But I was tired. My brain was fried. And that's when I saw the ad:

          28 seconds later, I had a website. It wasn't great. The colors were weird. The copy said "Streamline your workflow" three times in one paragraph. But it was <strong>done</strong>.

          Sarah was thrilled. The founder was thrilled. I sent the invoice: $8,000. They paid immediately.

          Week 4: "Can we add a blog section?"<br>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Each request added hours. Each "simple change" required workarounds. I was spending more time fighting the tool than I would've spent just building in Framer or Webflow from the start.

          Inside, I was sweating. The tool I'd built their landing page on <strong>could not do any of this</strong>. No portals. No real integrations. No CMS. No e-commerce beyond a Stripe button.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          "I don't understand," she said. "I thought we were done? Why do we need to rebuild?"

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            "We outgrew the tool," I said. Which was true. But what I didn't say was: <strong>I chose the wrong tool from the start.</strong>

          6 weeks. $39,000. And the whole time, I'm wondering: <strong>Why didn't I just use Webflow from the start?</strong>

          I would've been done in 4 weeks. For $25,000. Instead, I spent 10 weeks total and charged them $47,000 for work that should've cost half that.

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">If you can't answer this, don't launch. AI builders that can't scale will cost you 10x when you need to migrate.</p>

      <!-- FINAL THOUGHTS -->
      <section class="mb-16">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-6">So... Should You Use AI Builders?</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Yes. But not for everything.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>Durable AI</strong> is still my go-to for:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>• MVPs and landing pages (when speed matters more than anything)</li>
          <li>• Local businesses that will never need more than 5 pages</li>
          <li>• Testing ideas before committing to custom build</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>But I'll never make the same mistake again.</strong> Now I ask: "What happens when this works?" Because <em>of course</em> it's going to work. And then they'll want more. And your tool needs to be ready for "more."
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          $47,000 is an expensive lesson. But it's one I'll never forget.
