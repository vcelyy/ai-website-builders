              Looking for a free AI website builder? Most "free" plans are barely usable. Here's what you actually get for free, and what you'll have to pay for.

					<div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-6 my-8">
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-900">
							<strong>The reality:</strong> Every AI website builder offers a "free" plan. Most are unusable for anything real. Limited pages, huge watermarks, no custom domain, capped bandwidth. They're not free products—they're trials designed to push you to paid plans.
						</p>
					</div>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
What "free" actually means</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						AI website builders are businesses, not charities. Their free plans exist to get you hooked, not to serve you long-term. Here's what free plans typically include:
					</p>

					<ul class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<li><strong>Page limits:</strong> 1-3 pages max. Enough for a landing page, not a real site.</li>
						<li><strong>Branding:</strong> "Built with [Tool]" watermarks or badges. Looks unprofessional.</li>
						<li><strong>Domains:</strong> ugly subdomain like yoursite.framer.ai or yoursite.durable.co</li>
						<li><strong>Bandwidth:</strong> capped visitors or storage. Hit the limit and your site goes down.</li>
						<li><strong>Features:</strong> No export, no advanced features, limited AI generations.</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						This is by design. They want free plans to be just good enough to try, too limited to use seriously.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
Framer: Generous but still limited</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Framer's free plan is one of the better ones, but still has significant limitations.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What you get for free</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Unlimited pages (surprisingly generous). Full design editor. AI generation. Publishing on framer.ai subdomain. TLS certificate included.<br /><br />
						This means you can build a complete site and launch it publicly without paying. For testing or personal projects, this is actually usable.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What's locked behind paywall</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Custom domain requires paid plan ($15/month minimum). That's the big one—you can't use your own .com without paying.<br /><br />
						Export also requires $25/month plan. No way to get your code out on free.<br /><br />
						CMS features (blogs, collections) are paid-only. So is removing Framer branding.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Real example: Portfolio site</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Designer used Framer free plan to build portfolio. Published to name.framer.ai. Looked professional, worked fine. Used it for 6 months while job hunting.<br /><br />
						Once hired, needed proper domain. Paid $15/month. Free plan was great for testing, not for long-term branding.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
Durable: 14-day trial, not free</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Durable advertises "free" but it's a 14-day trial. That's it.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What you get for "free"</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Full access for 14 days. AI generation, editing, publishing. Everything works.<br /><br />
						But after 14 days, your site either goes offline or you start paying. There's no permanent free tier.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What happens after trial</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Pay $12/month minimum or lose your site. No migration path. No export. Either pay or rebuild elsewhere.<br /><br />
						This is the most aggressive freemium model I tested. Great for trying, terrible for long-term free use.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Real example: Weekend project</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Entrepreneur used Durable trial to test business idea. Generated landing page, got 200 visitors over weekend, validated concept.<br /><br />
						Then had to either pay $12/month or rebuild. Chose to rebuild in WordPress. Trial was perfect for validation, useless for ongoing free use.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
10Web: Limited but usable</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						10Web's free plan is restricted but functional for simple sites.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What you get for free</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						1 website. 10 pages. 1GB storage. AI generation included. 10Web subdomain.<br /><br />
						This is enough for a simple site—landing page, about, contact. But hit 10 pages and you're paying.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What's locked behind paywall</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Custom domain requires paid plan ($10/month minimum). More than 10 pages requires upgrade. More storage requires upgrade.<br /><br />
						But since it's WordPress, you can export your content easily. Moving to self-hosted WordPress is straightforward.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Real example: Simple local business</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Local bakery used 10Web free plan for website. Homepage, menu, contact. 6 pages total. Published to 10web subdomain.<br /><br />
						Worked fine for 8 months. Eventually needed custom domain for branding. Paid $10/month. Free tier was genuinely usable, just limited.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
Relume: Generous free tier</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Relume's free plan is actually useful, but remember—it's not a website builder.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What you get for free</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						3 projects. Full sitemap generation. Full wireframe generation. Export to Figma/Framer/Webflow.<br /><br />
						This is enough for real work. You can plan multiple sites, export wireframes, build elsewhere. No time limit.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What's locked behind paywall</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						More than 3 projects requires $20/month. But unlimited projects is the only real limitation—features are the same.<br /><br />
						If you only work on 1-2 sites at a time, free plan is all you need.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Real example: Agency workflow</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Design agency uses Relume free tier for client projects. Plan sitemap and wireframes for client A, export, build in Framer. Once live, archive that project, start client B.<br /><br />
						They've never hit the 3-project limit because they archive completed work. Free tier is indefinitely usable.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
The truly free alternatives</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						If you actually need free forever, AI website builders aren't the answer. Here's what is:
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Static site generators + free hosting</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<strong>Cost:</strong> $0-30/year total.<br /><br />
						Astro, Hugo, or Eleventy for site generation. GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for hosting. Custom domain costs $10-15/year.<br /><br />
						No AI generation, but genuinely free. Total cost is just domain registration. Fast, secure, scalable. This is what I use.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">WordPress.com free tier</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<strong>Cost:</strong> $0 forever, with limitations.<br /><br />
						3GB storage. WordPress subdomain. Limited themes. No plugins. But it's genuinely free and doesn't expire.<br /><br />
						Usable for simple blogs. Not for serious sites due to limitations, but it won't suddenly cost money.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Google Sites</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<strong>Cost:</strong> $0.<br /><br />
						Basic sites only. No e-commerce. Limited design. But it's free, unlimited, and won't expire. Good for internal docs, simple portfolios, not much else.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
The hidden costs of "free"</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Even when the plan is free, there are costs:
					</p>

					<ul class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<li><strong>Time:</strong> Free plans are often slower, have fewer features, require workarounds.</li>
						<li><strong>Professionalism:</strong> Subdomains and watermarks look unprofessional. Lost credibility costs money.</li>
						<li><strong>Lock-in:</strong> No export means rebuilding later. Time = money.</li>
						<li><strong>Migration:</strong> Moving from free to paid is easy. Moving from free to elsewhere is hard.</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						"Free" has opportunity costs. Sometimes paying $15/month saves hours of work.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
Decision framework</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						When should you use free plans vs paying?
					</p>

					<div class="my-8 p-6 bg-bg-alt border border-border border-[3px]">
						<p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-4">Use free plans when:</p>
						<ul class="text-sm text-gray-600 space-y-2 list-disc list-inside mb-6">
							<li>You're testing or learning</li>
							<li>You don't care about custom domain yet</li>
							<li>You're validating a business idea</li>
							<li>It's a personal project with no revenue</li>
							<li>You need something temporary</li>
						</ul>

						<p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-4">Pay for a plan when:</p>
						<ul class="text-sm text-gray-600 space-y-2 list-disc list-inside mb-6">
							<li>You need a custom domain for branding</li>
							<li>You're using this for a real business</li>
							<li>You need features locked behind paywall</li>
							<li>You want to remove watermarks/branding</li>
							<li>You're generating revenue from the site</li>
						</ul>

						<p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-4">Skip AI builders entirely when:</p>
						<ul class="text-sm text-gray-600 space-y-2 list-disc list-inside">
							<li>You want truly free, not freemium</li>
							<li>You're willing to learn Hugo/Astro</li>
							<li>You care about performance and control</li>
							<li>You don't need AI generation</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
Bottom line</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Free AI website builders exist, but they're limited by design. Framer and Relume have the best free tiers—genuinely usable for small projects. Durable is just a trial. 10Web is functional but constrained.<br /><br />
						If you need truly free forever, skip AI builders and use static site generators. If you're okay paying eventually, start with free tiers to test, then upgrade when you hit limitations.<br /><br />
						Just don't expect "free" to mean "unlimited." These are businesses, not charities.
