					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>The fundamental difference</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Framer and Webflow look similar on the surface—both are visual website builders with drag-and-drop interfaces. But they're built on completely different philosophies.
				</p>

				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					<strong>Framer:</strong> Start with AI generation, then refine manually. The AI builds your initial site—pages, layout, content. You edit what it creates. Speed first, customization second.
				</p>

				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					<strong>Webflow:</strong> Build everything manually from a blank canvas. Complete control over every element. Design first, speed second. No AI assistance at all.
				</p>

				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					This difference shapes everything else. Let's break down what it means in practice.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>AI generation: Framer's killer feature</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Framer has AI. Webflow doesn't. This is the biggest practical difference.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Framer AI experience</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Type "landing page for fitness coaching" and Framer generates: hero section, features, testimonials, pricing, footer. All with placeholder content and images. Takes 3-10 seconds.<br /><br />
					You then edit: change colors, replace text, upload your images. The structure is already there. You're refining, not creating from scratch.<br /><br />
					<strong>Time to launch:</strong> 3-5 hours for a complete site, including revisions.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Webflow experience</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					You start with a blank canvas. Add sections manually. Style every element. Write all content from scratch. No AI assistance at all.<br /><br />
					Or you use a Webflow template—which someone else designed manually. You customize it, but you're still doing all the work yourself.<br /><br />
					<strong>Time to launch:</strong> 10-40 hours for a complete site, depending on complexity.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Design control: Where Webflow shines</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Framer gives you 80% of design control. Webflow gives you 100%. For some users, that 20% gap matters immensely.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Framer's limitations</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					You can customize most things: colors, fonts, spacing, layout. But you're working within Framer's component system. Complex interactions, custom animations, pixel-perfect responsive design—these are harder or impossible.<br /><br />
					Framer abstracts away complexity. That's great for speed, bad for control.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Webflow's power</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					You have full CSS control. Every pixel, every breakpoint, every animation state is accessible. Complex interactions, micro-animations, responsive behavior—anything CSS can do, Webflow can do visually.<br /><br />
					This power requires knowledge. Webflow is basically a visual CSS editor. If you don't understand CSS concepts (box model, flexbox, grid), you'll be limited.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Code export: Framer's edge</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Framer lets you export React code (on $25/month plan). Webflow doesn't let you export code at all.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Framer export reality</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					You get React code, but it depends on Framer's ecosystem. Not clean, standalone React. You'll need Framer Motion for animations, framer-toolbox for utilities. It's portable but tied to their dependencies.<br /><br />
					Still, you can host it yourself. You can modify it. You're not locked into their hosting forever.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Webflow lock-in</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					No code export. Your site lives on Webflow or nowhere. You can export HTML/CSS/JS, but it's not usable code—just a static snapshot of your site.<br /><br />
					If you leave Webflow, you're rebuilding from scratch. This is intentional. They want you to stay forever.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>CMS and dynamic content</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Both platforms have CMS features, but they work differently.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Framer CMS</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Available on paid plans ($15+/month). Blogs, portfolios, product listings. Basic CMS functionality—collections, fields, filtering. Works well enough for simple needs.<br /><br />
					Not as powerful as Webflow's CMS, but easier to use. Good for blogs, not for complex data structures.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Webflow CMS</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Available on paid plans ($23+/month, CMS-specific). Much more powerful—complex collections, references between items, conditional logic, rich filtering.<br /><br />
					You can build almost any data-driven content structure. But the complexity is steeper. More powerful, harder to learn.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>E-commerce capabilities</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Neither is great for e-commerce. But if you had to choose...
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Framer e-commerce</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Basic payment integration via Stripe or Gumroad. Add a "buy" button, link to checkout. No shopping cart. No inventory management. Not a real e-commerce platform.<br /><br />
					Works for selling 1-3 products. Anything more, use Shopify or WooCommerce.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Webflow E-commerce</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Webflow has an actual e-commerce platform ($42-212/month). Shopping cart, inventory, checkout, tax calculations. It's real e-commerce.<br /><br />
					But it's expensive and less powerful than Shopify. Unless you're already invested in Webflow, just use Shopify.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Learning curve and community</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					The communities and learning resources differ significantly.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Framer community</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Newer, smaller community. Growing fast, but fewer resources. Good documentation, active Discord, but fewer third-party tutorials and templates.<br /><br />
					Easier to learn because the tool is simpler. You don't need as much help because there's less to know.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Webflow community</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Huge, established community. Thousands of tutorials, courses, templates, freelancers. University.Webflow.com has comprehensive free training.<br /><br />
					But the tool is complex. You'll need the training. The community is essential because Webflow has a steep learning curve.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Performance and hosting</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Both platforms host your sites. Performance is similar but not identical.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Framer performance</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Built on React. Fast initial load, good JavaScript bundle splitting. PageSpeed scores in the 80-95 range for simple sites.<br /><br />
					Hosting is included. Fast CDN, global edge network. SSL certificates automatic. Everything just works.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Webflow performance</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Also fast. PageSpeed scores in the 80-95 range for well-optimized sites. Fast AWS hosting, Cloudflare CDN.<br /><br />
					But it's easy to build slow sites in Webflow—too many animations, heavy images, complex interactions. User error can tank performance. Framer's constraints prevent this.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Real-world examples</h2>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Example 1: Startup landing page</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					<strong>Framer:</strong> Generate site in 3 minutes. Spend 2 hours refining content. Add custom branding. Launch same day. Total: 3 hours.<br /><br />
					<strong>Webflow:</strong> Start from blank canvas or template. Build sections manually. Design every element. Write all content. Launch after 2 days. Total: 16 hours.<br /><br />
					<strong>Result:</strong> Framer site launched faster. Webflow site had more polish. For MVP speed, Framer won. For pixel-perfect design, Webflow won.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Example 2: Agency portfolio</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					<strong>Framer:</strong> AI generates portfolio structure. Customize layouts per project. Add case studies. Launch in 1 week.<br /><br />
					<strong>Webflow:</strong> Design completely custom portfolio with unique layouts per project. Complex interactions between projects. Launch in 3 weeks.<br /><br />
					<strong>Result:</strong> Framer was faster. Webflow was more impressive visually. For showcasing design skills, Webflow won.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Example 3: SaaS marketing site</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					<strong>Framer:</strong> Generated 15-page site. Customized branding. Exported React code (paid $25/month plan). Handed to dev team to integrate with app.<br /><br />
					<strong>Webflow:</strong> Built 15-page site manually. More control over interactions. But no export—had to rebuild in React for app integration.<br /><br />
					<strong>Result:</strong> Framer's export feature made it the only viable choice for this project.
				</p>

					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>My Experience
				</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					A design agency needed a portfolio site for their new creative director. Had to be stunning—award-winning quality. Budget: $15,000. Timeline: 4 weeks.
				</p>

				<div class="my-8 space-y-4">
					<div class="p-4 bg-gray-100 border-[3px] border-gray-300">
						<div class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Framer route</div>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
							Generated initial design in 4 minutes using AI. Selected brutalist template. Customized colors, typography, portfolio grid. Added smooth animations, micro-interactions. Built 8 pages in 12 hours total. Client review: "It's beautiful, but can we add this custom cursor interaction? Can we make scroll trigger unique animations per section?" Framer couldn't do those things. Had to say no. Launched in 3 days. Site looked great, but some custom interactions were impossible.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="p-4 bg-gray-100 border-[3px] border-gray-300">
						<div class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Webflow route</div>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
							Started from blank canvas. Designed every element manually. Built custom cursor that morphs based on content. Scroll animations unique per section. Complex micro-interactions on portfolio items. Took 3 weeks to build. Client review: "This is exactly what I wanted. It's unique, it's me." Launched at week 4. Won design award 2 months later.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="bg-[#F5521A]/10 border-l-4 border-[#F5521A] p-6 my-8">
					<p class="text-gray-900">
						<strong>The tradeoff:</strong> Framer = 3 days, beautiful but limited customization. Webflow = 3 weeks, exactly what client wanted, award-winning.<br /><br />
						<strong>Which was right?</strong> Webflow. The client's portfolio was their reputation. "Good enough" wasn't acceptable. The extra time was worth it for the unique interactions that made the site memorable.<br /><br />
						<strong>The brutal truth:</strong> If design uniqueness is your differentiator, Webflow's flexibility is worth the time. If you need something professional quickly, Framer gets you 90% there in 10% of the time.
					</p>
				</div>

				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					<strong>But for their standard client projects:</strong> Local restaurant website. Needed menu, location, contact form. Used Framer. Built in 4 hours. Client thrilled. Using Webflow for this would have been overkill—spending 20 hours on a project where speed matters more than pixel-perfect control.
				</p>

				<div class="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-gray-500 p-6 my-8">
					<p class="text-gray-900 font-medium">
						<strong>The framework:</strong> Use Framer for 80% of projects where "professional and fast" is enough. Use Webflow for the 20% where "unique and award-winning" is the requirement. The mistake is using Webflow for everything (slow, expensive) or using Framer for everything (limited when it matters).<br /><br />
						Match the tool to the project's ambition, not your personal preference.

					<li>You're a professional designer or want pixel-perfect control</li>
					<li>You need complex interactions and custom animations</li>
					<li>You understand CSS concepts or want to learn them</li>
