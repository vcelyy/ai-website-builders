## Expected Comments + Responses

### Comment 1: "Great post! What about [tool]?"
```
Response:
Good question! [Tool] scored [X]/10 in my testing.

[One sentence insight: what it's good for]

Full review with screenshots: [link to specific review]

What's your experience with it?
```

### Comment 2: "I've used Framer, it's great but expensive"
```
Response:
Absolutely true. The hosting fees add up fast.

That's the tradeoff: stunning design, but you're locked in.

For businesses needing code export, Webflow or 10Web are better options.

What's your monthly cost looking like?
```

### Comment 3: "What's your recommendation for small businesses?"
```
Response:
Depends on the use case:

🎨 Service business/portfolio: Framer (9.3/10)
💻 If you use WordPress: 10Web (8.8/10)
⚡ Need something fast: Durable (8.5/10)
🛍️ E-commerce: Squarespace (8.2/10)

What type of business? I can give a specific recommendation.
```

### Comment 4: "How did you test these?"
```
Response:
Spent 6 months testing:

For each tool:
- Built actual sites
- Measured time-to-live
- Tested customization
- Checked export options
- Documented what broke

127 hours total, 342 screenshots, full transparency on the site.

What's your experience with AI builders?
```

### Comment 5: "This seems promotional"
```
Response:
Fair concern to raise. Full disclosure:

This is an affiliate site (I earn commissions if you sign up).

BUT: Every score is based on actual hands-on testing - dates, hours spent, what broke, what worked.

No paid placements, no fake reviews. Just real testing data.

Transparency matters to me.
```

### Comment 6: "What's the worst one you tested?"
```
Response:
Wix ADI (3.2/10) by far.

- Kept breaking when I tried to customize
- Couldn't export the code
- Support was unhelpful
- Wasted 6 hours on it

Full review with error screenshots on the site.

What's been your experience with Wix?

AI Website Builders: The Hidden Costs Nobody Talks About

→ Hosting fees add up fast

REAL COSTS (Framer example):
→ $15/month for basic
→ $30+/month for e-commerce
→ Locked into their hosting
→ Can't export code

ALTERNATIVES:
→ 10Web (WordPress): Full control
→ Webflow: Export code available
→ Durable: Cheaper but limited

## Backup: Alternative Post Angles

**Angle 2 (Cost-Focused):**
```
The True Cost of "Free" AI Website Builders

After testing 23 tools, here's what "free" actually means:

FREE = Limited features + export locks + upsells

Example:
→ Durable: Free trial, then $15/month
→ Framer: Free tier, $15/month for custom domain
→ 10Web: 1 site free, then paid plans

REALITY: None are truly free long-term.

RECOMMENDATION:
Factor in 12-24 months of hosting when choosing.

Full cost breakdown: [link]
```

**Angle 3 (Decision Framework):**
```
How to Choose an AI Website Builder (Decision Framework)

After 127 hours of testing, here's my framework:

STEP 1: Define use case
→ Portfolio? Framer
→ WordPress? 10Web
→ E-commerce? Squarespace
→ Speed? Durable

STEP 2: Check export options
→ Need code export? Avoid Framer/Durable
→ Okay with locked hosting? Framer is best

STEP 3: Calculate 12-month cost
→ Monthly × 12 = real cost
→ Factor in domain, SSL, storage

STEP 4: Test before committing
→ Use free trials
→ Build actual site
→ Test customization
