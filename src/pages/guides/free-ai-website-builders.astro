All have critical limitations that prevent serious use: no custom domain (you get buildername.site), limited pages (2-3 pages maximum), no code export (platform lock-in), forced builder branding on your site, and feature restrictions that cripple functionality. Free plans are trials for testing, not tools for building real websites. The only exception is Relume which offers 3 free projects with full features for wireframing, but Relume isn't a website builder—it generates sitemaps and you still need Framer or Webflow to build. For genuine free-forever websites, use WordPress.org (free software, pay only for hosting), Ghost (free self-hosted), or static site generators like Hugo/Jekyll (completely free). These require technical skills and no AI generation, but you own the site and can host it anywhere."

For actual website building: Durable has a 30-day free trial (fastest AI generation, requires credit card, site deleted after trial), Framer has a free tier with 2 pages and Framer branding (good for testing, unusable for production), 10Web has limited free tier with 1 site and restricted AI generations, and Mixo has a generous free tier with Mixo branding and subdomain only. For testing: Durable (30-day trial) and Framer (2 pages free) are best.

The biggest hidden cost: when the free plan limitations become unacceptable, migrating requires rebuilding everything from scratch. No product export, no order history transfer, no customer data export. You lose all your work when switching platforms. Budget $9-20/month from day one if you're serious about your website."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "No, free AI website builders are not suitable for business use. Reasons: subdomain URLs (yourname.framer.site) look unprofessional and reduce credibility, builder branding on your site signals amateur operation, limited pages prevent full business websites, no custom domain hurts email marketing (name@yourname.com vs name@yourname.framer.site), SEO penalties from free subdomains reduce organic traffic by 40%, platform lock-in makes migration expensive later, and feature limitations cripple business functionality. For any business or professional use, budget $9-20/month for Mixo or Durable basic plans. The $108-240 annual cost delivers custom domain, no builder branding, full features, and professional credibility. Your website is your business face—don't cripple it to save $10/month."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Free trials are temporary limited access that expires (Durable: 30 days, then your site is deleted). Free tiers are permanent access with ongoing restrictions (Framer: 2 pages forever, but can't expand without paying). Free trials require credit cards and auto-convert to paid plans when they expire—expensive surprises if you forget to cancel. Free tiers don't require credit cards and let you stay limited forever. Both serve the same purpose: let you test the platform before committing to payment. Free trials work best when you want full access temporarily to evaluate features. Free tiers work best when you want permanent minimal access for testing or hobby projects. For production websites, neither works—budget for paid plans from launch."

          "text": "Free AI website builders make money through: subscription fees for premium features (custom domains, more pages, code export, advanced features), upselling during the user journey (constant prompts to upgrade when you hit limits), using your data to train their AI models (your content improves their product for free), displaying builder branding on free sites (free advertising for them on your work), and hoping free users convert to paid subscribers (typically 2-3% conversion rate from free to paid). The business model: offer enough free value to attract users, cripple features enough to force upgrades, and rely on the small percentage who convert to paid plans to subsidize all free users. You're either paying customer or training data—the product is never actually free."

          "text": "For genuinely free website building without monthly fees: WordPress.org (free software, pay only $3-10/month for hosting, complete control, thousands of plugins), Ghost (free self-hosted software, $5/month hosting, excellent for blogs), Hugo/Jekyll (static site generators, completely free, require technical skills), and Google Sites (free but very limited features). These require technical skills—no AI generation, manual setup, and you build everything yourself. But you own the site, can host it anywhere, no monthly platform fees beyond hosting, and no feature limitations. The trade-off: spend time to save money, or spend money to save time. AI website builders charge for convenience ($9-20/month saves you hours of technical work). If you have zero budget and some technical skills, WordPress.org with cheap hosting is the only genuinely free-forever option."

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">No custom domain</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					This is the big one. Your site lives at:
				</p>
				<div class="bg-gray-100 border-[3px] p-6 my-8 border-[3px] border-gray-300">
					<p class="text-gray-600 font-mono text-sm">your-site.framer.site</p>
					<p class="text-gray-600 font-mono text-sm">your-site.10web.site</p>
					<p class="text-gray-600 font-mono text-sm">your-site.durable.co</p>
				</div>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					That looks unprofessional. Clients won't take you seriously. Google ranks branded subdomains lower. If you want <code>yourname.com</code>, you're paying monthly.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Can't export your site</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Build a site for free, then want to leave? You can't. Framer and Durable don't export on free plans. 10Web technically lets you export, but it's WordPress—good luck moving that elsewhere without breaking things.
				</p>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					This is the lock-in. You build it, they host it, you pay forever or lose your work.
				</p>

				<div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6 my-8">
					<p class="text-sm">
						<strong>Think of it like renting:</strong> You're building on someone else's land. If you stop paying rent, you lose the building. That's fine for testing, terrible for long-term business assets.
					</p>
				</div>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Limited features</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Free plans are intentionally crippled:
				</p>
				<ul class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					<li><strong>Framer:</strong> Limited to 2 pages, no custom domain, can't export</li>
					<li><strong>10Web:</strong> 1 site only, limited AI generations, no premium plugins</li>
					<li><strong>Durable:</strong> 7-day trial, then your site is deleted</li>
					<li><strong>Relume:</strong> Only 3 projects, and it's just wireframes anyway</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Their branding on your site</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Some free plans add "Made with X" badges or links in the footer. You can usually remove them by paying, but on free plans, you're advertising for them.
				</p>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					That's fine for a hobby project. For a business? Looks amateur.

					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>So are any of them actually usable for free?</h2>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Relume AI: Maybe, if you understand what it is</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Relume's free tier gives you 3 projects with full features. But Relume isn't a website builder—it generates sitemaps and wireframes. You still need Framer or Webflow to actually build the site.
				</p>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					So if you're planning and wireframing, Relume's free tier is genuinely useful. If you want to launch a site, it's not the right tool.

					<p class="text-sm">
						<strong>Relume is the only "free" plan that's not crippled.</strong> You get full access to features, just limited to 3 projects. If you need wireframing (not building), it's actually free-forever usable.

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Everything else: No, not really</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Framer, 10Web, Durable—all are free for testing, not production. You can:

				<ul class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">

					<li>Build a demo site</li>
					<li>See if you like the interface</li>

					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>The actually-free alternative</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					If you want a genuinely free website:
				</p>
				<ul class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					<li><strong>WordPress.org:</strong> Free software, pay only for hosting (~$3-10/month)</li>
					<li><strong>Ghost:</strong> Free for self-hosted (~$5/month hosting)</li>
					<li><strong>Hugo/Jekyll:</strong> Static site generators, completely free</li>
					<li><strong>Google Sites:</strong> Free but very limited</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					These require technical skills. No AI generation. You build everything yourself. But you own it, you can host it anywhere, and there's no monthly fee beyond hosting.

				<div class="bg-[#F5521A]/5 border-l-4 border-[#F5521A] p-6 my-8">
					<p class="text-sm">
						<strong>The reality:</strong> AI builders charge for convenience. You're paying to skip the technical work. If you're willing to do the work yourself, WordPress + free hosting is genuinely free-forever. If you want AI to do it for you, you'll pay monthly.

									<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">No AI website builder is actually free for production use. All have critical limitations that prevent serious use: no custom domain (you get buildername.site), limited pages (2-3 pages maximum), no code export (platform lock-in), forced builder branding on your site, and feature restrictions that cripple functionality. Free plans are trials for testing, not tools for building real websites.</p>
									<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">The only exception is Relume which offers 3 free projects with full features for wireframing, but Relume isn't a website builder—it generates sitemaps and you still need Framer or Webflow to build. For genuine free-forever websites, use WordPress.org (free software, pay only for hosting), Ghost (free self-hosted), or static site generators like Hugo/Jekyll (completely free).</p>

									<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-3"><strong>Free tiers</strong> are permanent access with ongoing restrictions (Framer: 2 pages forever, but can't expand without paying). Free tiers don't require credit cards and let you stay limited forever.</p>
									<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">Both serve the same purpose: let you test the platform before committing to payment.

          Brutal truth: "Free" websites cost more in lost revenue and frustration than paid plans
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
          <strong>For serious use:</strong> Pay $15-20/month from day one. Custom domain, no watermarks, full features. Professional presentation pays for itself.<br/>
          <strong>For testing:</strong> Use Durable's 14-day free trial (no credit card). Fully test platform, AI generation, features. Commit or walk away without surprise charges.<br/>
          <strong>For temporary/personal:</strong> Free plans work for events, student projects, personal sites. But understand limitations: watermarks, storage, bandwidth, features.<br/>
          <strong>Remember:</strong> Time is money. Hitting limits, migrating platforms, fixing watermarked sites costs hours. $15-20/month buys freedom from these frustrations. Spend money to save time and sanity.
