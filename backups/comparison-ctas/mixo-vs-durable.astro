          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Both are incredibly fast at 8.5/10 each. Mixo generates sites in under 60 seconds with $9/month pricing. Durable takes 1-2 minutes and costs $15/month but includes built-in CRM. Mixo wins for pure speed and price—under 60 seconds to launch, $6/month cheaper. Durable wins if you need business features—CRM, invoicing, lead management included. Both use similar AI technology for content generation. The question isn't which is better overall, but which is better for YOUR needs. Mixo for landing pages and simple sites. Durable for service businesses needing customer management. Real testing showed Mixo launched in 6 minutes total vs Durable's 10 minutes. But for a consulting business with lead tracking, Durable saved $50/month in separate CRM software. Choose based on whether you need CRM or just a website."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Mixo costs $9/month with all features included. Durable costs $15/month but includes CRM features. Over 3 years, Mixo costs $324 while Durable costs $540—a $216 difference. Mixo also has one of the best free tiers available for testing. Durable includes more business features for the higher price—CRM, invoicing, lead management, marketing automation. If you would otherwise pay $20-50/month for separate CRM software, Durable's higher price actually saves money. If you just need a website, Mixo's lower price wins. If you need business tools, Durable justifies the extra cost. The question is: do you need CRM? If no, Mixo saves $72/year. If yes, Durable saves money vs separate subscriptions."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "No, neither Mixo nor Durable offer code export. Both are proprietary hosted platforms—your website lives on their servers permanently. If you leave either platform, you'll need to rebuild your site from scratch. This is platform lock-in. Both are designed as all-in-one hosted solutions, not development tools. If code export matters to you, consider Framer ($15-35/month) which also has fast generation and offers React code export. Or Webflow ($23-59/month) for complete design control with code export. For most users who just want a website online without technical complexity, the lack of code export on Mixo and Durable isn't a problem. For developers and agencies who need code ownership, both platforms have limitations."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Mixo is the fastest at 9.5/10 speed score—generates complete websites in under 60 seconds. Real testing: Mixo generated a consulting landing page in 47 seconds, required 5 minutes of edits, total launch time was 6 minutes. Durable generates in 1-2 minutes (9.0/10 speed score)—real testing: Durable generated the same landing page in 78 seconds, required 8 minutes of edits, total launch time was 10 minutes. Both are incredibly fast compared to traditional website builders which take hours or days. The 4-minute difference in total time isn't significant for most users. Both deliver same-day launches. Speed shouldn't be your deciding factor unless every second counts (emergency situations, time-sensitive launches). Both platforms excel at rapid website generation—the difference is negligible for most use cases."

      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Does Durable's CRM justify the extra $6/month vs Mixo?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Durable's built-in CRM includes: contact management (track all leads in one place), invoicing (send invoices directly from the platform), lead tracking (see who visited your site), email marketing basics, task management for follow-ups. If you're a service business (consultant, agency, freelancer), these features replace separate subscriptions. Real testing: Consulting business using Durable saved $50/month by ditching separate CRM subscription. That's $600/year saved vs Durable's $72/year higher price = net savings of $528/year. For businesses needing CRM, Durable pays for itself 7x over. If you're NOT a service business—bloggers, portfolios, simple landing pages—Durable's CRM features are wasted money. Use Mixo, save $72/year, don't pay for features you won't use. The $6/month difference seems small until you multiply by whether you actually need the features. Be honest about your use case."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Mixo has better template variety with 50+ base styles across different industries. The designs feel more modern and contemporary. Durable has fewer templates (around 15-20) but focuses on business/consulting aesthetics. However, both use AI to generate custom layouts based on your prompt, so you're not stuck with exact templates. Real testing: Mixo generated a more visually striking landing page with better visual hierarchy. Durable's design was more functional and business-focused. For creative businesses (design portfolios, photography, lifestyle brands), Mixo's aesthetic advantage matters. For professional services (consulting, B2B, agencies), Durable's business-focused approach works better. Both generate professional, functional designs. The difference is aesthetic personality, not quality. Mixo for modern and trendy. Durable for polished and professional."

        "name": "When should I choose Durable over Mixo for CRM features?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Choose Durable over Mixo if: You're a service business (consultant, coach, agency, freelancer), you need to track leads and customers, you send invoices for your services, you want email marketing integrated, you need task management for follow-ups, you're tired of juggling multiple tools, your business depends on repeat customers and ongoing relationships. Durable becomes valuable when you're running a real business, not just hosting a website. The CRM replaces: Calendly ($12/month), basic CRM ($15/month), invoicing tool ($20/month), email marketing ($10/month). That's $57/month in separate subscriptions that Durable replaces. If you need 3+ of those tools, Durable saves money despite the higher price. If you're just launching a simple website without customer management, Mixo is the better choice—faster, cheaper, sufficient for basic needs."

          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">4-Minute Difference Negligible</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Mixo: 6 minutes total. Durable: 10 minutes total. Both same-day launches. Speed shouldn't be your deciding factor unless you're launching emergency sites (storm season roofers). For everyone else, the difference is insignificant compared to feature/pricing considerations.</p>

          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">CRM Value Multiplies at Scale</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">One consulting client = $180. Ten clients = $1,800. Durable's CRM tracks all of them, sends invoices, automates follow-ups. Mixo requires manual management or separate tools. At 20+ clients, Durable becomes essential, not optional. Platform lock-in is real but so is tool juggling.</p>

          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Mixo Aesthetic Advantage</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Mixo generated more visually striking designs with better visual hierarchy. Durable felt more functional and business-focused. For creative businesses, Mixo's aesthetic advantage matters. For B2B consulting, Durable's professional look works better. Pick based on your brand personality.</p>

          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Platform Lock-in Affects Both</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Neither offers code export. Both lock you in. If you leave, you rebuild from scratch. This is the biggest risk factor with both platforms. However, for simple sites, rebuilding isn't catastrophic. For complex sites with hundreds of pages, consider Webflow/Framer with export capability. The lock-in is the price you pay for speed.</p>

          <div class="text-4xl mb-3">💰</div>
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">$72/Year Adds Up</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">$6/month seems trivial. $72/year seems minor. But over 5 years, that's $360. Over 10 years, that's $720. If Mixo meets your needs, you're wasting money on Durable. Conversely, if Durable's CRM saves you $600/year in separate tools, the $72 premium pays for itself 8x over. Small monthly differences compound dramatically over time.</p>

          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Use Case Determines Winner</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Blogger: Mixo wins (saves $72/year). Consultant: Durable wins (saves $528/year). Both are 8.5/10 overall because they excel at different use cases. The platform isn't the variable—your business type is. Stop asking "which is better" and start asking "better for MY business?" This one distinction saves or costs you hundreds per year.</p>

          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">AI Generation Quality Nearly Identical</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Both generated excellent copy with accurate business language. Both understood the consulting prompt and produced relevant content. Both created professional designs. The 4-minute speed difference and aesthetic variation are minor compared to how similarly both platforms perform their core function: AI website generation. You're choosing between two excellent AI generators. The decision comes down to ancillary features (CRM) not core quality (AI generation). Either platform will give you a great website in under 10 minutes.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Speed</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
          <strong>Mixo is faster.</strong> Generates complete websites in under 60 seconds with AI-generated content.
        </p>

          <strong>Durable is very fast too.</strong> Takes 1-2 minutes, which is still incredibly quick compared to traditional builders.

        <p class="text-gray-700">
          <strong>Mixo is website-focused.</strong> Excellent for websites but lacks built-in business management features.

          <strong>Durable costs more.</strong> $15/month but includes CRM features that would cost extra elsewhere.
