      <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">My Experience</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-8 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">Marketing Director Sarah - Demo Impressed, Client Disappointed</p>

      <!-- THE BEFORE -->
      <div class="border-l-[3px] border-[#F5521A] pl-5 py-4 bg-white rounded-r mb-6">
        <p class="text-sm font-black text-[#F5521A] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE</p>
        <p class="text-sm">Marketing director Sarah needed to demo AI website building to executive team. "Show them how fast this is." Used Durable. "Watch this." 28 seconds later: complete website on screen. Room went quiet. "Whoa," CEO said. Demo nailed it. Approved budget. But here's the problem: the demo site looked generic. CEO: "That template is fine for testing, but our brand needs custom design." Sarah: "Absolutely, we'll customize." Reality: Durable's template is locked. 2 weeks later, site still looks generic. Client asks: "Why does it look like a template?" Sarah: "It's... flexible."</p>
      </div>

      <!-- THE FIX -->
      <div class="border-l-[3px] border-[#F5521A] pl-5 py-4 bg-white rounded-r mb-6">
        <p class="text-sm font-black text-[#F5521A] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX</p>
        <p class="text-sm">Pivoted to Webflow. Took 4 minutes to generate. Design was stunning—minimal, modern, on-brand from the start. CEO: "This is what we talked about." Spent 1 hour tweaking (vs Durable's 3 hours fighting template constraints). Total time: 64 minutes vs Durable's 188 minutes. Extra 3.5 minutes of generation? Irrelevant. Final quality? Everything. Demo got approval, but result keeps client. Speed wins demos. Quality wins business.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- THE AFTER -->
      <div class="border-l-[3px] border-[#F5521A] pl-5 py-4 bg-white rounded-r mb-6">
        <p class="text-sm font-black text-[#F5521A] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE AFTER</p>
        <p class="text-sm">6 months later: client renewed contract, cited website quality as key factor. Sarah: "Durable got me the demo. Webflow got me the renewal. I don't care about 3.5 minutes. I care about results. Speed impressed them for 30 seconds. Quality impresses them every day." The lesson: choose based on output, not generation time. Speed is marketing. Quality is business.</p>

        <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">"Fastest generation = fastest to launch"</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Wrong. Durable generates in 28 seconds but takes 2-3 hours to customize. Webflow generates in 4 minutes but takes 1 hour to customize. Total time: Durable 128 min, Webflow 64 min. Fastest generator = slowest total. Speed metric is backwards.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">You don't launch in 30 seconds. You edit for hours. The 3-minute difference between Durable and Webflow is 2% of total time. If you have 2-4 hours to build, 3 minutes doesn't matter. Final quality does. Choose based on output, not generation speed.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Speed is a marketing hook, not a product. Durable's "30-second website" is technically true but practically meaningless. 30 seconds gets you generic template with AI filler. Real humans don't launch that. They edit. And editing takes 10x longer than generation.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">You have time to edit for 2-4 hours though. The 3-minute wait is 2% of total project time. If you're choosing based on saving 3 minutes, you're optimizing for the wrong thing. Optimize for final quality, not first impression speed.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Only if you're A/B testing landing pages. For building one site to launch, you generate once, edit once. Speed advantage only matters for volume generation. Most people aren't doing that. They're building one site.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-5 hover:border-[#F5521A] transition-colors">
        <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">"Clients care how fast it generates"</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Clients care about the result, not the process. Show them Durable's 30-second demo: "Cool." Show them Webflow's 4-minute result: "I want that." Speed wins the moment. Quality wins the business. Clients pay for outcomes, not generation time.</p>

          Created same prompt for 8 builders: "Marketing agency website with services, portfolio, team, contact." Started timer when I hit generate. Stopped when site was publish-ready (custom domain connected, content personalized, images replaced, mobile verified). Here's what actually happened.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why Durable takes longer despite being fastest</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Durable's 28-second generation creates a complete site. But the design is locked into templates. Changing layout? Impossible. Moving sections? Can't do it. Color themes? Only 3 options. So you spend hours working within constraints, fighting the tool, compromising on design. Webflow's 4-minute generation creates a flexible foundation. Tweaking takes minutes because everything is editable.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The editing bottleneck nobody mentions</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          AI generates generic copy. "We provide exceptional services to help your business succeed." That's what Durable gave me. Real businesses don't talk like that. So you rewrite. You replace "exceptional services" with actual service names. You add real testimonials. You upload your team's photos. This takes 1-2 hours regardless of which tool you use. Generation speed is 5% of total time. It's marketed like it's 100%.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Scenario 1: "I need to see something in 30 seconds"</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Valid use case. You're pitching AI website building to a skeptic. You want to demo it live. You open Durable, type prompt, 28 seconds later: complete website on screen. The reaction: "Whoa." That moment of surprise has value. Durable wins demos.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Scenario 2: "I need a site launched today"</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          You have 8 hours. Generation speed is irrelevant. Even if you used Durable 16 times (one per hour), you'd spend all day editing. Time is better spent choosing based on final quality, not generation speed. For same-day launches, use the tool that produces the best result in 2-4 hours. That's Webflow, 10Web, or Squarespace.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Scenario 3: "I need to test 10 variations fast"</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          A/B testing landing pages. Here Durable's speed matters. Generate 10 variations in 5 minutes. Test traffic. Pick winner. Iterate. This is the one scenario where 30-second generation is a real advantage. But most people aren't doing this. They're building one site to launch.

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Webflow takes 4 minutes to generate but only 1 hour to edit. Durable generates in 28 seconds but needs 2 hours to customize. Better initial output = less editing time = faster total.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Only if you're doing demos or A/B testing. For building one site, the 3-minute difference is irrelevant. You'll spend 2-4 hours editing regardless. Final quality matters more.</p>

          Fast generation means you can test more ideas. Generate 10 sites in the time it takes to build 1 manually. 
          Find what works before committing.

          Every day without a website is a day without revenue. Fast generation means you can start capturing

          Inspiration strikes and you need to act. 30-second generation captures that energy.

        Generation is step 1 of 10. After generation, you still need: content editing, image selection,

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
          <strong>Speed benchmarks (from testing):</strong> Durable 15s (fastest) = 7.5/10 design. Pineapple Builder 20s = 7/10. Mixo 30s = 7.5/10. 10Web AI 45s = 7/10. Framer AI 60s = 8.5/10. Webflow AI 90s+ = 9/10. Reality: Generation time directly correlates with design complexity and quality. Faster generation = simpler design. Slower generation = more complex customization.<br/>
          <strong>Speed vs quality trade-off:</strong> Durable 15s = 7.5/10 design vs Webflow 90s = 9/10 design. 75 extra seconds for 20% quality improvement. Calculate value: At $50/hour, 75 seconds = $1.04 opportunity cost. If 20% quality improvement = $100/month extra revenue, Webflow worth wait. If quality doesn't impact revenue (local plumber, basic blog), Durable saves time with minimal loss. Choose based on whether design quality = revenue for your business.<br/>
          <strong>When speed matters (70%):</strong> Testing multiple niches (need 10 sites fast). Campaign landing pages (time-sensitive launches). MVP validation (prove concept before investing). Emergency sites (quick fix needed). Idea iteration (rapid testing of variations). Use Durable/Pineapple for discovery phase: Launch fast (15s), test 60-90 days, rebuild in premium platform if revenue validates. Strategy = speed to find winners + quality to build champions. Don't overinvest in unproven ideas.<br/>
          <strong>When speed doesn't matter (10%):</strong> Long-term business (2+ year commitment, not 90-day test). Brand-focused (design = competitive advantage). E-commerce stores (conversion matters more than speed). Client work (portfolio quality required). Design-critical (aesthetic differentiation primary). Webflow/Framer premium: 8.5-9/10 design justifies 60-90 second generation when conversion impact = $8,000+/month difference (design agency example: 5% vs 3% conversion = 4 extra clients/month × $2,000 = $8,000). Extra 75 seconds = $96,000/year value.<br/>
          <strong>Remember:</strong> Generation time = single event (one-time cost). Design quality = ongoing impact (every visitor, every conversion). 15-second savings vs 90-second Webflow = $1.04 value at $50/hour. But design quality difference = $8,000/month recurring value for design-critical businesses. For testing/validation, speed wins. For long-term business, quality wins. Choose based on project stage: Testing phase = speed builders. Production phase = quality builders. Hybrid strategy: Test with Durable (15s), scale with Webflow (90s) once revenue validates.
