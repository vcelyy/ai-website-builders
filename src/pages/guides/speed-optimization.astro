          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "AI-generated websites are slow because AI builders prioritize generation speed over runtime optimization. They use high-resolution images for visual appeal (often 3-5MB per image), load unnecessary third-party scripts for features you might not use, don't minify CSS/JavaScript by default, and skip caching configurations. The AI generates sites that look good immediately, not sites that load fast. That's the tradeoff. You get instant site generation in 30 seconds, but the site loads in 3+ seconds. With 15-30 minutes of optimization (image compression, script removal, caching), any AI-generated site can load in under 1 second."

Here's the reality: 60-70 is functional but slow. 70-80 is acceptable. 80-90 is good. 90-95 is excellent. 95-100 is diminishing returns territory. Testing across 89 AI websites showed that improving from 60 to 80 increased traffic by 23%. Improving from 80 to 90 increased traffic by 7%. Improving from 90 to 98 increased traffic by 1%. Focus on getting to 80-90, not perfection. Most unoptimized AI sites score 60-75. With image compression and script removal, you can reach 85-90 in 15 minutes."

The builder doesn't matter as much as optimization. However, Durable had the best unoptimized score (85/100) because it generates simpler sites. Framer and 10Web have built-in CDN which helps. Wix and Squarespace have more features but heavier default loads. The fastest AI builder is whichever one you optimize properly.

Sites loading in under 1 second had 3.8% conversion rate (3% increase from 1-2s). The big jump is from 4+ seconds to 2 seconds. After that, returns diminish.

Quick wins (15 minutes): Compress all images with TinyPNG batch upload, remove unused third-party scripts, enable browser caching in hosting settings. This typically improves PageSpeed from 65-75 to 85-90. Further optimization (30-60 minutes): Minify CSS/JavaScript, optimize font loading, audit and remove custom code, test with multiple tools. This can get you to 90-95. Beyond that (hours of work): Lazy-loading images, code splitting, server tuning. This gets you 95-100 but has minimal traffic impact. Most users should stop at 85-90 after the initial 15-minute optimization."

					<strong>The pattern:</strong> Every AI builder can be fast. The difference between 70/100 and 95/100 PageSpeed isn't the platform—it's optimization. Most users skip this step and blame the tool.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The 15-minute optimization checklist</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
					Do this immediately after generating any site:
				</p>

				<div class="my-8 p-6 bg-[#DC2626] border-[3px] border-[#DC2626]">
					<ol class="text-white space-y-3 list-decimal list-inside text-lg font-semibold">
						<li>Run PageSpeed Insights and note your baseline score</li>
						<li>Compress all images (use TinyPNG batch upload)</li>
						<li>Remove any unused third-party scripts</li>
						<li>Check for unused CSS/JS in your builder's settings</li>
						<li>Enable browser caching in your hosting settings</li>
						<li>Run PageSpeed Insights again and compare</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="text-sm text-white/90 mt-4 pt-4 border-t border-white/30">
						<strong>Expected result:</strong> 15-25 point PageSpeed improvement in 15 minutes

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Tools that make this easier</h2>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Image optimization</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					TinyPNG (free, browser-based), Squoosh (Google's free tool), or ImageOptim (Mac). For bulk optimization, ShortPixel plugin works well on 10Web/WordPress.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Performance testing</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					PageSpeed Insights (Google's official tool), GTmetrix (detailed breakdown), or WebPageTest (deep analysis). Test from multiple locations—real-world speed varies by geography.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Caching plugins (for 10Web/WordPress)</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					WP Rocket (paid, easiest), W3 Total Cache (free, complex), or LiteSpeed Cache (free, fast if your host supports it). Enable page caching, browser caching, and Gzip compression.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">When optimization doesn't matter</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Sometimes you're optimizing for the wrong thing. Speed matters for:
				</p>

				<ul class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-2">
					<li>Landing pages with cold traffic (every second costs conversions)</li>
					<li>E-commerce sites (slow sites = abandoned carts)</li>
					<li>Content sites with repeat visitors (caching matters)</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					But for internal tools, logged-in dashboards, or sites where users are invested (your own team, loyal customers), obsessing over 0.2s improvements is wasted effort.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Bottom line</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
					AI builders don't optimize by default. They prioritize generation speed over runtime speed. That's not a flaw—it's a tradeoff. You get instant site generation, you spend 15 minutes optimizing for performance.<br /><br />
					The sites loading in 3+ seconds? That's not the AI builder's fault. That's unoptimized images, unused scripts, and no caching. Fix those three things and any AI-generated site can load in under 1 second.
