            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Westfield Academy, K-12 private school in Seattle WA (established 2011). $25,000 annual tuition. Strong academics: 94% college placement, 12:1 student-teacher ratio. Website from 2012: broken on mobile, curriculum buried 6 clicks deep, no virtual tour, faculty listed as names only. 47 open seats despite strong academics. Competitor 2 miles away (same tuition, similar stats): beautiful Webflow site with curriculum pages, principal video, faculty bios with photos, event calendar prominent. They had a 40-family waitlist. Westfield's director: "We're better educators, but they win the enrollment game."</p>
