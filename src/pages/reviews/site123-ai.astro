    description: 'Client emergency: site needed live by 6 AM for funding announcement. No budget, no time. Tested Site123\'s speed claim.',
    finding: 'Site123 delivered on the speed promise. 2:03 AM: started process. 2:05 AM: answered 5 questions (business name, type, color preference). 2:07 AM: site generated and published. Total time: 4 minutes from start to live URL. The site looked basic—generic template, stock photos, minimal styling. Client didn\'t care: "It\'s live, that\'s what matters." For emergency "I need something online now" situations, Site123 is the fastest path to done. But you\'ll want to rebuild it properly later. It\'s the digital equivalent of duct tape—ugly but holds things together.'

    title: 'Template Quality Assessment',
    description: 'Evaluated Site123\'s template library. Counted templates, assessed design quality, checked for visual variety.',
    finding: 'The template library is tiny and repetitive. Total templates: ~15. Visual variety: low—all use similar layout patterns (hero-box, features-box, testimonials-box). Design quality: 2016-era basic—functional but dated. Customization: limited color changes, font selection from presets, no layout modifications. After building 5 different test sites, they all looked like siblings—same structure, different colors. The "123" in the name isn\'t marketing—it reflects the simplicity. You get a site in 123 seconds, but it looks like it was built in 123 seconds.'

    title: 'Free Plan vs Paid Reality Check',
    description: 'Tested Site123\'s free plan to see if it\'s actually usable or just a tease. Compared to Mixo and Durable free tiers.',
    finding: 'The free plan exists but is heavily limited. Free: site123.com subdomain (unprofessional), Site123 branding on footer, limited templates (5 options), no e-commerce. It\'s usable for testing but embarrassing for business use. For comparison, Mixo free gives better templates and cleaner branding. Durable free includes CRM features on free tier. Site123 free is "try before you buy" not "free forever." If budget is absolute zero, Mixo or Durable free tiers are better. Site123\'s only advantage: pure simplicity—fewer options, fewer decisions, faster to deploy.'
  },
  {
    date: 'Oct 6, 2024',
    title: 'Ease of Use vs Capability Tradeoff',
    description: 'Tested Site123\'s ease of use claim by building sites with different requirements. Documented where simplicity became a limitation.',
    finding: 'The ease is real but comes with hard limits. Setting up basic site (5 pages): 5 minutes, genuinely easy. Adding e-commerce: can\'t do on free plan, need upgrade. Adding custom domain: works but requires upgrade. Adding blog: available but basic (no categories, limited media). Modifying layout: can\'t move sections, stuck with template structure. After 20 minutes, I hit a wall where I wanted to do something Site123 couldn\'t do without upgrading or starting over. The simplicity that makes it fast also makes it rigid. It\'s brilliant for "I need a 3-page site now" and terrible for "I need a custom website." Know the limits before you start.'
  },
  {
    date: 'Oct 13, 2024',
    title: '24/7 Support Quality Test',
    description: 'Tested Site123\'s 24/7 support with 3 questions at different times: technical issue, feature question, billing inquiry.',
    finding: 'Support is available 24/7 but quality varies. Chat 1 (11 PM technical): 2-minute wait, agent solved issue in 5 minutes—helpful. Chat 2 (3 AM feature): 4-minute wait, agent gave unclear answer, had to follow up—annoying. Chat 3 (8 AM billing): 1-minute wait, immediate clear answer—excellent. The support exists around the clock but tier-1 agents handle basic issues well, complex problems less so. For the target user (beginners with simple questions), support quality is adequate. The availability is more valuable than depth—knowing you can get help at 3 AM matters when you\'re panicking about a deadline.'

              Restaurant owner built site in Site123. Showed it to friends. "Hey, that looks just like my cousin's site." "My dentist has the same layout." Site123 has maybe 15 templates total. Millions of users. Do the math—your site will look identical to thousands of others. For a business trying to stand out, looking generic is worse than having no site. Rebuilt in Wix for unique design.

              Started on Site123's free plan. Worked okay. Then wanted to connect custom domain. "Upgrade to Premium." Wanted to remove Site123 branding. "Upgrade to Professional." Needed more storage. "Upgrade to Business." What started as "free" became $25/month. Meanwhile, Mixo offers better free tier, and Framer is $15/month. Site123's pricing tiers feel designed to nickel-and-dime you into upgrades.

        Mixo AI is also beginner-friendly but offers better templates, AI content generation, and more customization options.

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Durable AI has more features including a built-in CRM and AI copywriting tools.

      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Both cost about the same as Site123 but deliver significantly more value. Site123 only makes sense if you want the absolute simplest option available.
