## Thread Structure (8 tweets)

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
I tested 23 AI website builders so you don't have to.

Here's what 127 hours of testing taught me about AI-generated websites...

🧵
```

### Tweet 2 (Durable - Speed)
```
2/ The fastest tool was Durable.

30 seconds from sign-up to live site. ⚡

But it looked... generic. Like every other Durable site.

The design tools were limited. You get what it gives you.

🧵
```

### Tweet 3 (Framer - Design)
```
3/ The best design was Framer.

9.3/10 - stunning templates, great animations.

BUT: You're locked into their hosting.

Can't export code easily. Monthly fees add up fast.

🧵
```

### Tweet 4 (10Web - WordPress)
```
4/ For WordPress users: 10Web AI.

Seamless WordPress integration.

AI generates pages based on your content.

But: Learning curve if you're new to WordPress.

70% commission makes it worth it though.

🧵
```

### Tweet 5 (The Truth)
```
5/ The truth about AI website builders:

They're great for:
- Quick MVPs
- Portfolios
- Basic sites

They're terrible for:
- Complex features
- E-commerce (in most cases)
- Full control

🧵
```

### Tweet 6 (Worst Experience)
```
6/ The worst experience?

Wix ADI (3.2/10).

- Kept breaking when I tried to customize
- Couldn't export code
- Wasted 6 hours

Avoid unless you want frustration.

🧵
```

### Tweet 7 (Recommendations)
```
7/ So what should you use?

🎨 Portfolios: Framer (9.3/10)
💻 WordPress sites: 10Web (8.8/10)
⚡ Speed: Durable (8.5/10)
🛍️ E-commerce: Squarespace (8.2/10)

## Engagement Templates

**Reply to "Great thread!":**
```
Thanks! Took 127 hours to test everything. Full breakdown on the site with scores for all 23 tools.
```

**Reply to "What about [tool]?":**
```
Good question! [Tool] scored [X]/10. [Quick insight]. Full review: [link to specific review]
```

**Reply to "This seems like an ad":**
```
Fair concern. I built this because existing "best AI builder" lists are just affiliate spam with no real testing. Every score on my site is from actual hands-on testing - dates, hours, what broke, what worked.
```

**Reply to "Framer is overrated":**
```
Valid take. It locks you into their hosting (can't export code). But for pure design quality and speed, nothing beats it. Webflow is better if you need code export, but steeper learning curve.
