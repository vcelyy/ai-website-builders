ADI asks questions about your business, industry, and goals, then generates a complete website with pages, content, and images. The Wix Editor provides more control with AI-powered content generation and design suggestions. With 500+ templates, 500+ apps in the marketplace, and features for every use case, Wix is one of the most comprehensive website builders available. Best for users who want maximum features and flexibility."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "No, Wix does NOT offer code export. Your website is tied to Wix hosting. Unlike Framer or Webflow which allow code export for self-hosting or custom development, Wix sites must stay on the Wix platform. This is fine for most users who plan to stay with Wix long-term, but limits portability. If code export is important to you, consider Framer or Webflow instead. Wix compensates with extensive features, app integrations, and reliability that make staying on the platform worthwhile for many users."

          "text": "Yes, Wix has capable e-commerce features built-in. Wix Stores includes product management, inventory tracking, multiple payment options (Square, Stripe, PayPal), shipping calculation, and order management. While not as powerful as dedicated platforms like Shopify for large stores, Wix e-commerce is excellent for small to medium online stores. The advantage is having your website and online store in one platform. For very large or complex e-commerce operations, Shopify or 10Web (WooCommerce) may be better. For most small businesses selling products, Wix is perfectly adequate."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Wix ADI is better for complete beginners who want fast results. It uses AI to generate a complete website in 5-15 minutes based on Q&A. Trade-off: less customization control, generic results, harder to deviate from template. Wix Editor is better for users who want design control and customization. It's a drag-and-drop visual editor with complete freedom but steeper learning curve. Best approach: Start with ADI to get a foundation quickly, then switch to Editor to customize. You can convert ADI sites to Editor sites, but not vice versa. Most users: ADI for speed, Editor for control."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Wix averages 60-70 PageSpeed scores vs Framer's 95+. Why: Heavy platform overhead, unoptimized app JavaScript, shared hosting resources, automatic features you can't disable. Wix loads a lot of code by default for features you may not use. Every app adds more JavaScript, slowing loading further. Wix is optimizing with Wix Speed and accelerated mobile pages (AMP), but platform architecture limits how fast sites can get. For SEO-critical sites, Framer or Webflow are faster. For most small business sites, Wix speed is adequate but not exceptional. Speed isn't Wix's strength—features are."

Result: content formatting destroyed, headers disappeared, footers vanished, custom sections misaligned, 14 hours to fix. Wix templates are not interchangeable. Each template has different structure, fonts, colors, section layouts. Switching means rebuilding. Choose carefully first time. Unlike Framer/Webflow where you can change themes while preserving content, Wix templates are permanent commitments. Pick a template you can live with long-term or be prepared to rebuild."

Removed unused apps (down to 8), score jumped to 67/100 mobile, 72/100 desktop. Every app adds JavaScript, every script blocks rendering, every HTTP request adds latency.

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">"Why do I need to edit mobile separately?" User asks on forums. Desktop looks fine, mobile is completely broken. Wix's separate mobile editor exists because responsive design fails catastrophically. You're not "editing for mobile"—you're rebuilding from scratch. Budget double the time for every page. Other platforms: responsive is automatic. Wix: mobile is manual work. The feature is presented as flexibility—it's actually fixing broken responsive.</p>

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">Launched restaurant site on free Wix plan. Customer feedback: "Your food looks legit but those Wix ads make me question if this is a real business or just testing." Another: "I was about to order online but saw the Wix ad footer—felt unprofessional, closed tab." Free tier ads signal "temporary," "testing," "not serious business." Upgrade immediately or lose trust. $16/month is credibility insurance.</p>

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">Wix ADI generated a "complete website" in 10 minutes. Generic template, filler lorem ipsum content, wrong structure for business needs, irrelevant stock images. Took 4 hours to fix everything—rewrite copy, replace images, restructure pages, fix navigation. Would have been faster to start from blank template. ADI is marketing, not a real tool. Use ADI to see possibilities, then rebuild from scratch with Wix Editor.</p>

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">Calculated 3-year costs for 100-product store. Wix E-commerce Business: $50/month × 36 = $1,800 plus transaction fees. Shopify Basic: $29/month × 36 = $1,044 with better features. Squarespace Commerce: $46/month × 36 = $1,656 with included features. Wix has most features but you pay premium. For small stores, Wix is adequate. For growing stores, Shopify or Squarespace offer better value. Wix e-commerce is convenient, not cost-effective.</p>

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">Service business built client site on Wix for 2 years. Business scaled, needed custom CRM integration, advanced booking logic, customer portal. Wix couldn't do it. Migration to custom: $8,000 in developer labor, 3 weeks downtime, lost $12,000 in bookings. Same scenario on Framer: download code, hand to developer, 1 week migration. Wix lock-in isn't theoretical—it's expensive when you leave. If there's ANY chance you'll need custom features, consider Framer/Webflow first.</p>

            <strong>THE BRUTAL TRUTH:</strong> Every Wix app you install slows your site permanently. Each app adds JavaScript that blocks rendering, increases load time, reduces PageSpeed. More apps ≠ better site. More apps = slower site = fewer conversions. Only install apps you actually need. Less is more.

            <strong>THE EXCEPTION:</strong> If you absolutely need an app's functionality and there's no other way, install it. But calculate the cost: $29/month app that adds 3 seconds load time and loses you 10 customers/month? That app costs you money, not makes money. Test with and without apps. Measure conversion impact.

          <strong>Start with ADI for structure, then customize heavily.</strong>

          Use ADI to generate the basic page structure (Home, About, Services, Contact). Then replace everything - all the text, all the images, all the colors. You get the speed of ADI with the customization of templates.

          <strong>Local businesses with low competition.</strong> If you're the only plumber in a small town, Wix SEO is fine.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Non-competitive niches.</strong> Personal sites, hobbies, portfolio sites where SEO doesn't drive revenue.
          <br><br>
          <strong>You value simplicity over optimization.</strong> Wix SEO is easy. WordPress SEO requires plugins, configuration, and ongoing maintenance.
          <br><br>
          <strong class="text-green-600">The rule: If SEO generates less than 30% of your traffic, Wix is sufficient.</strong>
