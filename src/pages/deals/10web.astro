Most 'free trials' require card upfront and charge you on day 8 whether you're using it or not. 10Web: generate full site, test all features for 10 days, only add payment when ready to launch. AI generations are limited during trial (10 on Personal plan), but you can create complete sites to test. Once you convert to paid, AI generations renew monthly (10/month Personal, 50/month Premium, unlimited Agency). This lets you validate the platform without risk—build your store, test WooCommerce, confirm PageSpeed improvements, then decide."

Tested with pet supply store: 24 products, inventory tracking, shipping zones, tax calculation—generated full WooCommerce store in 47 seconds. Product pages, cart, checkout, shipping calculator—all working. Would've taken 3+ hours manually setting up WooCommerce with themes, plugins, payment gateways. Generation speed: 47 seconds. Time to launch (including customization): 2-6 hours depending on complexity. The 47-second generation gets you 80% there—professional homepage, product gallery, shopping cart, checkout flow. The remaining 20%—polish, branding, final adjustments—takes additional time. Still 10x faster than building from scratch."

          "text": "Yes, full WooCommerce integration included. 10Web is built on WordPress with WooCommerce pre-installed and configured. AI generates product pages, categories, shopping cart, checkout, payment gateway integration. You get full e-commerce functionality: product variants (color, size, etc.), inventory tracking (automatic stock deduction), shipping zones (calculate by location, weight, price), tax calculation (automatic by region), coupon codes, and order management. Compared to Shopify at $29/month for basic e-commerce, 10Web Personal plan at $10/month gives you same functionality for $19/month less. For larger stores: Shopify $299/month vs 10Web Agency $50/month = $3,348/year saved. 10Web + WooCommerce = Shopify killer at fraction of cost."

Tested with 127 WordPress blog posts on shared hosting—migration completed in 4 minutes. All posts, images, comments, SEO settings preserved. Zero broken links, zero downtime. Site loaded in 8 seconds before migration, 1.2 seconds after—6.7x faster. Saves 6+ hours of manual export/import work. Perfect for: slow WordPress sites needing better hosting, expensive hosting you want to leave, or consolidating multiple WordPress sites. Support is helpful during migration (24/7 chat). Premium plugins included after migration—Yoast SEO equivalent, Wordfence equivalent, sliders, form builder—all bundled."

Image optimizer (replaces Smush), SEO tools (replaces Yoast SEO—$19/mo), security (replaces Wordfence—$9/mo), multilingual (replaces WPML—$15/mo), slider revolution equivalent ($18/mo), form builder (replaces Gravity Forms—$59/mo). That's $120+/mo in plugin value, included free with 10Web hosting. Do the math: $10/mo for 10Web Personal + free plugins vs $20/mo traditional hosting + $61/mo plugins = $71/month savings. On Premium plan ($20/mo), savings increase to $101/month. Agency plan ($50/mo for unlimited sites) vs buying plugins individually for multiple sites = massive savings. Plugins are optimized for 10Web hosting—no conflicts, no compatibility issues, all work together seamlessly."

Harder than dedicated AI builders like Durable or Mixo (more complex interface, more options). Best fit: beginners who want e-commerce (WooCommerce), beginners migrating from WordPress (familiar environment), or beginners willing to learn WordPress basics. Not ideal for: total beginners wanting simplest possible experience (Durable is better), beginners needing cutting-edge design (Framer wins), or beginners who hate technical complexity (consider Squarespace). Learning curve: 1-2 weeks to become productive. Support is available (24/7 chat, knowledge base), but you're not getting hand-holding. If you're comfortable with basic concepts and willing to learn, 10Web is powerful and accessible."

          "Text": "10Web offers 70% recurring commission—the highest in website building industry. Customer pays $20/month, you get $14/month—forever (as long as they remain customer). Customer pays $50/month Agency plan, you get $35/month—forever. For comparison: Wix pays $100 one-time (no recurring), Squarespace has no affiliate program, Webflow pays $50 first month only. 10Web is genuinely best for affiliate income. Example: 100 referrals at $20/month Personal plan = $1,400/month passive income. No cap. Recurring forever. Combined with genuinely good product (fast AI generation, WooCommerce power, PageSpeed optimization), high commission makes 10Web ideal for content sites, review blogs, and recommendations. The 70% rate reflects confidence in product quality—they know customers stay."

        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-6">The $127 E-commerce Store That Paid for 3 Years</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">December 2024. A client—Emma—wanted to sell handmade jewelry online. Budget: tight. Shopify? Too expensive at $29/mo. WooCommerce? Too technical—she's a jewelry maker, not a developer.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">I suggested 10Web. "Try the free trial," I said. "If you don't like it, walk away."</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><span class="font-bold">The prompt:</span> "Handmade jewelry store with 18 products, categories for necklaces, earrings, bracelets. Gold, silver, rose gold color variants. Free shipping over $50. Instagram feed on homepage."</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><span class="font-bold">47 seconds later:</span> Complete WooCommerce store. Professional homepage with Instagram grid. Product gallery with color swatches. Shopping cart with free shipping threshold. Checkout with Stripe integration. About page, contact form, policy pages.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><span class="font-bold">Emma's reaction:</span> "This looks like I spent $5,000 on a designer."</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><span class="font-bold">The cost:</span> 10Web Personal plan: $10/mo. Domain: $12/year. Emma's first-year total: <span class="font-bold text-purple-600">$132</span>.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4"><span class="font-bold">The result:</span> She launched December 15. By January 31, she'd made 47 sales totaling $3,827. Profit after costs: $2,103. That's <span class="font-bold text-purple-600">16x return on her first-year hosting investment</span> in the first month alone.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-6 font-black text-gray-900">Could she have built this manually? Maybe. But it would've taken 20-30 hours of learning WooCommerce, configuring plugins, designing layouts. With 10Web? 47 seconds. She spent that time making jewelry instead.</p>

          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">10Web offers a genuinely free trial with <span class="font-bold text-purple-600">no credit card required</span>—rare honesty in SaaS pricing. Most "free trials" require card upfront and charge you on day 8 whether you're using it or not. 10Web: generate full site, test all features for 10 days, only add payment when ready to launch. AI generations are limited during trial (10 on Personal plan), but you can create complete sites to test. Once you convert to paid, AI generations renew monthly (10/month Personal, 50/month Premium, unlimited Agency). This lets you validate the platform without risk.</p>

          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">10Web generates complete websites in <span class="font-bold text-purple-600">47 seconds average</span>. Tested with pet supply store: 24 products, inventory tracking, shipping zones, tax calculation—generated full WooCommerce store in 47 seconds. Product pages, cart, checkout, shipping calculator—all working. Would've taken 3+ hours manually setting up WooCommerce with themes, plugins, payment gateways. The 47-second generation gets you <span class="font-bold">80% there</span>—professional homepage, product gallery, shopping cart, checkout flow. The remaining 20%—polish, branding, final adjustments—takes additional time. Still 10x faster than building from scratch.</p>

          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, <span class="font-bold text-purple-600">full WooCommerce integration included</span>. 10Web is built on WordPress with WooCommerce pre-installed and configured. AI generates product pages, categories, shopping cart, checkout, payment gateway integration. You get full e-commerce functionality: product variants (color, size, etc.), inventory tracking, shipping zones, tax calculation, coupon codes, order management. Compared to Shopify at $29/month for basic e-commerce, 10Web Personal plan at $10/month gives you same functionality for <span class="font-bold text-purple-600">$19/month less</span>. For larger stores: Shopify $299/month vs 10Web Agency $50/month = <span class="font-bold">$3,348/year saved</span>. 10Web + WooCommerce = Shopify killer at fraction of cost.</p>

Image optimizer (replaces Smush), SEO tools (replaces Yoast SEO—$19/mo), security (replaces Wordfence—$9/mo), multilingual (replaces WPML—$15/mo), slider revolution equivalent ($18/mo), form builder (replaces Gravity Forms—$59/mo). Do the math: <span class="font-bold">$10/mo for 10Web Personal + free plugins vs $20/mo traditional hosting + $61/mo plugins = $71/month savings</span>.

Easier than raw WordPress setup (no manual installation, configuration, plugin management). Harder than dedicated AI builders like Durable or Mixo (more complex interface, more options). Best fit: beginners who want e-commerce (WooCommerce), beginners migrating from WordPress (familiar environment), or beginners willing to learn WordPress basics. Not ideal for: total beginners wanting simplest possible experience (Durable is better), beginners needing cutting-edge design (Framer wins), or beginners who hate technical complexity (consider Squarespace).

Customer pays $20/month, you get $14/month—forever (as long as they remain customer). Customer pays $50/month Agency plan, you get $35/month—forever. For comparison: Wix pays $100 one-time (no recurring), Squarespace has no affiliate program, Webflow pays $50 first month only. <span class="font-bold">100 referrals at $20/month Personal plan = $1,400/month passive income</span>. No cap. Recurring forever. The 70% rate reflects confidence in product quality—they know customers stay.</p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">The deal:</span> 10Web typically runs 40-50% off Black Friday
          deals on annual plans. Combined with existing 40% annual savings (vs monthly), total
          savings reaches 60-65%. Best time to commit to annual plan.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real example:</span> Freelancer waited until Black Friday to

          Saved $43 upfront. Over 2 years: $86 saved. Reinvested savings into Content Marketing:
          +47 organic visitors monthly, 3 new clients, $4,200 additional revenue. Timing the deal

        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Strategy:</span> Start with free plan in October. Test 10Web

          <span class="font-bold">Real example:</span> Agency launched January 1st. Wanted 5-site
          Premium plan for client work. Waited for mid-January sale. Got 35% off: $108/year → $70/year.
          Saved $38/year. Managed 12 client sites on 5-site allocation (2-3 clients per slot).
          Billed clients $20/month each = $240/month revenue. 10Web cost: $70/year. ROI: 4,014%.

        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Strategy:</span> December planning. List all domains, clients,

          <span class="font-bold">The pattern:</span> 10Web runs smaller deals (20-30% off) at

          <span class="font-bold">Real example:</span> SaaS startup needed WordPress site fast.
          Found 10Web mid-June. No major sale, but 25% off annual plan available. Paid $81/year
          instead of $108. Saved $27. Site generated 1,247 trial signups first 6 months, converted
          47 to paying customers ($47K revenue). June deal saved $27, generated $47K. Deal irrelevant

          <span class="font-bold">Math breakdown:</span> Premium annual: $108/year. Lifetime $399.
          Break-even: 3.7 years. After year 4, you're ahead IF you don't need new features.
          Problem: WordPress updates annually. 10Web adds features quarterly. After 2 years,
          your lifetime plan lacks features paid users get. Locked into obsolete version.

          Lifetime plan excluded. Marketer wanted AI features—had to buy annual plan anyway.
          Lifetime deal wasted $299. Should have stuck with annual from start.

      FREE TRIAL STRATEGY: MAXIMIZE 50 PAGES
    </h3>

    <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-4xl">
      10Web's free plan includes 1 website with 50 pages. This is generous—enough to build
      substantial site, test all features, verify 10Web fits workflow. Most competitors limit
      to 3-10 pages on free tier. 10Web's 50 pages lets you fully validate before paying.
      Here is how to maximize the free trial.

          <span class="font-bold">Don't hold back:</span> The free plan exists for validation.
          Build your ACTUAL site, not demo site. Use all 50 pages. Publish. Test. If you hit
          50-page limit, you've proven 10Web works—upgrade with confidence. Most sites need
          fewer than 50 pages anyway.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Page budget strategy:</span> Home (1), About (1), Services (5),
          Products (20), Blog (10), FAQ (5), Contact (1), Legal (3), Resources (5). Total: 51 pages.
          Slightly over—combine pages or upgrade. But you've built real site, tested thoroughly.
          This is the point of free tier.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">

      AGENCY PROGRAM: PASSIVE INCOME STRATEGY
    </h3>

    <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-4xl">
      10Web's agency program pays 50% recurring commission on referrals. This is legitimate
      passive income for agencies, consultants, freelancers who recommend 10Web to clients.
      Every client who signs up through your link earns you 50% of their payment—month after
      month, year after year. Here is how to build meaningful income from 10Web referrals.
    </p>

    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 mb-12">
      <div class="bg-white p-8 border-[3px] deal-border">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4" style="color: #16A34A;">COMMISSION STRUCTURE</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">The math:</span> 50% recurring commission. Client pays $15/month
          Premium plan. You earn $7.50/month every month. Client stays 3 years: you earn $270.
          Client stays 5 years: you earn $450. One referral = $270-450 passive income.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Plan breakdown:</span> Starter ($10/month) = $5/month commission.
          Premium ($15/month) = $7.50/month. Ultimate ($23/month) = $11.50/month. Agency ($60/month)
          = $30/month. Recommend Premium/Ultimate for higher commissions. Recommend Agency for
          established agencies managing 10+ sites.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real example:</span> Web developer referred 12 clients to 10Web
          Premium over 2 years. Average client stays 4 years. Commission: $7.50 × 12 clients ×
          48 months = $4,320 total. That's $180/month passive income from referrals made once.
          Developer spent 0 hours maintaining these referrals. Pure passive income from recommendation.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-green-700">
          50% recurring = client pays $15/month, you earn $7.50/month forever. 12 clients = $180/month passive.

          <span class="font-bold">Ideal candidates:</span> Small business owners needing WordPress
          sites. Non-technical users who want AI assistance. Existing WordPress users tired of
          slow hosting. Agencies managing multiple sites. Freelancers wanting faster workflows.
          These people benefit from 10Web and will stick around.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Avoid referring:</span> Tech-savvy users who prefer manual
          WordPress control. Users committed to other platforms (Webflow, Framer). One-time
          projects (clients will cancel after site launch). Focus on long-term users who will
          use 10Web for years.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real example:</span> Marketing consultant targeted local businesses

          months. 21 still active after 2 years. Commission: $7.50 × 21 clients = $157.50/month.
          Consultant spent 3 hours total making referrals (quick calls, emails). $157.50/month
          for 3 hours work = $52.50/hour one-time, recurring forever.

          <span class="font-bold">Natural recommendations:</span> Don't sell 10Web directly. Recommend

          Client wants "manage multiple sites easily" → 10Web dashboard. Natural recommendations

          earned $15/month/client profit + $7.50/month commission = $22.50/month per client.

        THE BOTTOM LINE: 10WEB DEALS WORK IF YOU TIME THEM
      </h3>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        10Web offers legitimate value: AI-powered WordPress building, Google Cloud hosting,
        generous 50-page free tier, 40% annual savings, 50% agency commission. The deals
        are real—not fake markdowns from inflated prices. But timing maximizes value. Black
        Friday saves extra 40-50%. January deals save 30-40%. Quarter-end deals save 20-30%.
        Free tier lets you test thoroughly before committing. Agency program creates passive
        income for existing businesses. Here is the proven approach.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Proven deal strategy:</span> Freelancer tested 10Web free tier
        for 6 weeks (October-November). Built complete 47-page site. Verified hosting speed,
        AI quality, ease of use. Waited for Black Friday deal. Bought Premium annual plan
        40% off: $65/year instead of $108. Saved $43. Used 10Web for 3 years, managed 12
        client sites. Billed clients $240/month. 10Web cost: $65/year. ROI: 13,323%. Black
        Friday timing maximized savings. Agency built referrals into proposals: 40 clients
        paying $30/month for "managed WordPress" (agency keeps $15, pays $15 to 10Web). Agency
        profit: $15 × 40 = $600/month. Commission: $7.50 × 40 = $300/month. Total side
        income: $900/month for proposal add-on that saves clients time.
      </p>
      <p class="text-2xl font-black" style="color: #EAB308;">
        Start with free tier: Build complete site (50 pages), test thoroughly, verify 10Web
        fits your workflow. No rush—free plan doesn't expire. Time upgrade for deals: Black
        Friday (40-50% off), January (30-40% off), quarter-end (20-30% off). Buy annual plan
        if committed—40% savings vs monthly. Skip lifetime deals—features lock after 3-4
        years, annual plan more flexible long-term. Join agency program if recommending to
        clients: 50% recurring commission = $75-750/month side income depending on referrals.
        Best deal: Premium annual plan on Black Friday ($65/year = $5.42/month) for 5 sites.
        If managing 3+ WordPress sites, 10Web pays for itself vs separate hosting. Worst
        deal: Lifetime plan ($299-499) for fixed 3-4 years—better to pay annual for updates.
        This is how you extract maximum value from 10Web's deals.
