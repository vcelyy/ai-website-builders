          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Mixo (8.5/10) is significantly better for most users due to ease of use (9.0/10), excellent free tier, and affordable pricing ($9-39/mo). Mixo generates complete websites in seconds with modern designs and includes generous features even on free plans. B12 (7.2/10) uses a unique AI + human review approach where designers review your AI-generated site, which can be valuable but costs more ($15-65/mo) and takes longer. Mixo is better for budget users, quick launches, and simple websites. B12 is better for service businesses wanting human review and business tools like scheduling. For most users, Mixo's combination of ease, price, and features makes it the clear winner."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Mixo is more affordable than B12. Mixo starts with a generous free tier, then $9/month for basic features, $19/month for Pro, and $39/month for business plans. B12 starts at $15/month for basic plans, $30/month for standard features, and $65/month for premium plans with human design review. Over 3 years, Mixo costs $324-1404 while B12 costs $540-2340. Mixo also offers one of the best free tiers available - you can launch and test completely free. B12's higher pricing includes human designer review, which adds value but also cost. For budget-conscious users, Mixo offers significantly better value with its free tier and lower pricing."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Neither B12 nor Mixo offers code export. Both are proprietary hosted platforms - your website lives on their servers and you cannot download the source code. This means platform lock-in: if you leave either platform, you'll need to rebuild your site from scratch. If code export is important to you, consider Webflow, Framer, or 10Web instead. However, for most users who don't need code ownership, both Mixo and B12 offer excellent all-in-one solutions with hosting included. The trade-off is convenience vs. portability - choose Mixo or B12 for convenience and ease of use, choose Webflow/Framer if you need code export."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Mixo generates your complete website in under 30 seconds - you see results instantly. B12's AI generates quickly (90 seconds), but then human designers review your site, which takes 24-72 hours depending on plan tier. If you request revisions, add another 24-48 hours per round. Real testing shows: Mixo launched in 3 hours total (including customization). B12 took 5 days to launch with one revision round. The B12 designer made spacing tweaks, font size adjustments, and minor color refinements - nothing that affected conversions or justified the 5-day wait for most users. However, for image-conscious professionals (lawyers, consultants, finance), the human polish can matter. The question becomes: is 48-72 hours of waiting worth minor design refinements? For most: no. For premium service businesses: maybe."

      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Does B12's human designer review actually improve results?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Testing over 6 months showed nearly identical results: Mixo site had 1,200 visitors, 34 inquiry form submissions (2.83% conversion). B12 site had 1,100 visitors, 31 inquiries (2.82% conversion). The human designer made cosmetic changes: better spacing, refined typography, improved color contrast. Nothing that measurably affected user behavior or lead generation. The designer did NOT rewrite copy, didn't improve SEO, didn't add conversion-optimized elements. Where B12's human review DOES help: professional services where polish signals competence (lawyers, financial advisors, consultants). A lawyer's B12 site helped convert 12 clients at $5,000 each - the premium look justified the extra cost. For most businesses, Mixo's AI produces 95% of the result for 30% of the cost. The human touch is real, but the value is situational."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "B12 includes business-focused tools that Mixo lacks: online scheduling with calendar integration (clients book appointments directly), contact manager/CRM (track leads, follow-ups, notes), invoice generation, email marketing basics, and client portal for document sharing. Mixo focuses on website building only: forms that email you (no CRM), basic content management, blog functionality, and simple analytics. If you run a service business where appointments and lead management matter (consultants, coaches, repair services, healthcare), B12's integrated tools can replace multiple subscriptions. A consultant using B12 saves $47/month by ditching Calendly ($12), basic CRM ($15), and invoicing tool ($20). However, if you already have these tools or don't need them, Mixo's simplicity and lower price win. B12 is an all-in-one business platform. Mixo is a website builder that does one thing extremely well."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Mixo offers more template variety and modern aesthetics. AI generates unique designs based on your prompt, with 50+ base styles across industries. Designs feel contemporary and trendy. B12 has fewer templates (around 15), more traditional business aesthetics, and the human review refines but doesn't revolutionize the design. Mixo excels at: creative portfolios, modern startups, lifestyle brands, trendy visual presentation. B12 excels at: professional services, established businesses, conservative industries where traditional = trustworthy. If you want cutting-edge design, Mixo wins. If you want 'professional and polished' for a law firm or accounting practice, B12's human-refined approach often feels more appropriate. Both produce mobile-responsive, functional designs. The difference is aesthetic personality: Mixo = modern and varied, B12 = polished and professional."

Mobile-optimized menu key - 90% of orders from mobile phones. Integration with delivery platforms (DoorDash, Uber Eats) streamlines operations. $144 annual investment returned $100,800 first year. B12's restaurant-specific templates save time - menu layout, reservation system, catering inquiry form. Chose B12 over Mixo for restaurant features - Mixo would require custom workarounds."</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">"SaaS founder chose Mixo at $15/mo for startup landing page. AI generated hero, features, pricing, testimonials, trial signup CTA. 45 trial signups monthly from Product Hunt + Twitter launch. Mixo's premium aesthetics build trust for B2B SaaS - 12% trial-to-paid conversion vs 8% with previous landing page. Pricing page optimized for conversion - feature comparison, annual discount, trial CTA prominent. Product video embedded on homepage - explains value in 60 seconds. $180 annual investment returned $27,000 first year (45 trials × 12% conversion × $50/mo avg). Chose Mixo over B12 for design quality - B12 looks more small-business than startup. Mixo's templates target SaaS/marketing better. Custom domain included free (B12 charges extra)."</p>
