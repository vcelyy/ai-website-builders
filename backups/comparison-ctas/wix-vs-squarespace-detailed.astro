          "text": "Squarespace wins slightly overall (8.3/10 vs 8.2/10) with superior design quality (8.5/10 vs 8.0/10), faster loading speed (8.5/10 vs 8.0/10), and consistently polished templates that always look professional. Wix offers more features with its massive app marketplace (5000+ apps), more flexibility (7.5/10 vs 7.0/10), more affordable pricing starting at $10/month vs $23/month, and greater template variety (800+ vs 100+). Squarespace is better for: design-focused users wanting polished results, portfolios and visual brands, restaurants and creative businesses, users who prioritize design over features. Wix is better for: users needing specific features from apps, e-commerce with more options, complex websites requiring add-ons, budget-conscious users. Choose Squarespace for consistently polished design. Choose Wix for maximum features and flexibility."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Wix and Squarespace have significantly different pricing structures with Wix being much more affordable at entry levels. Wix starts at $10/month for basic sites, $18/month for unlimited plans, up to $46/month for e-commerce and business features. Over 3 years, Wix costs $360-1656 depending on plan level. Squarespace starts at $23/month for personal websites, $33/month for business plans, up to $65/month for commerce features. Over 3 years, Squarespace costs $828-2340 depending on plan level. For basic websites, Wix is more than twice as affordable ($10 vs $23/month base pricing). For business features, the gap widens ($18 vs $33/month). Wix's more affordable pricing, combined with its extensive app marketplace, makes it better value for budget-conscious users. Squarespace's higher pricing reflects its design quality and polish - worth it for users prioritizing aesthetics. For most users, Wix provides better value while Squarespace justifies its premium with superior design."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Neither Wix nor Squarespace offer code export - both platforms lock you into their hosting permanently. Your website stays on their servers and you're committed to their platform. This is different from competitors like Framer and Webflow which do offer code export on paid plans. With both Wix and Squarespace, you don't own your code and can't migrate to custom development or other hosting. If code export matters for your long-term strategy, consider Framer or Webflow instead. If you don't care about code export, both Wix and Squarespace are fine choices - just understand you're committing to their platforms. Platform lock-in is the trade-off for the convenience, features, and professional results these builders provide. For most users who just want a working website without technical complexity, this trade-off is acceptable. Choose based on features vs. design priorities, not code export."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Both Wix and Squarespace offer solid e-commerce, but they excel differently. Squarespace has beautiful, polished e-commerce templates that make products look professional. Built-in features include product management, inventory, discounts, shipping zones, and abandoned cart recovery. However, Squarespace e-commerce is more rigid - fewer customization options for product pages and checkout flows. Wix offers more e-commerce flexibility through its app marketplace. You can add advanced product filters, subscription billing, wholesale pricing, multi-vendor marketplaces, and complex shipping rules through apps. However, this requires installing and paying for multiple add-ons. For simple stores with standard products, Squarespace is easier and looks better. For complex e-commerce requiring custom functionality, Wix with apps offers more options. The trade-off: Squarespace is beautiful but rigid. Wix requires more setup but offers more customization. Budget also matters - Wix e-commerce starts cheaper, but adding apps can quickly exceed Squarespace pricing."

      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Which platform loads faster: Wix or Squarespace?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Squarespace generally loads faster (8.5/10 vs Wix's 8.0/10) due to optimized templates and cleaner code structure. Squarespace sites typically score 75-85 on Google PageSpeed Insights. Wix sites often score 65-75 due to heavier templates and app overhead. The speed difference comes from architecture: Squarespace templates are more streamlined with fewer dependencies. Wix allows more apps and customizations, which can slow down sites if overused. For most users, the difference is noticeable but not dramatic - both are decent. For mobile users and SEO-conscious sites, Squarespace has a speed advantage. However, Wix's speed varies significantly based on how many apps you install - a minimal Wix site can be fast, while a feature-heavy Wix site can be slow. If speed is critical for your use case (e.g., mobile-heavy audience, SEO priority), Squarespace has the edge. If you need features that justify a slight speed penalty, Wix is acceptable."

      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Do Wix apps cost extra and how much should I budget?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes, many Wix apps cost extra on top of your monthly subscription. Wix's app marketplace has 5000+ apps, and while some are free, premium apps typically cost $5-30/month each. Common app costs: Advanced booking systems ($15-29/mo), email marketing ($10-25/mo), enhanced forms ($5-15/mo), live chat ($10-20/mo), membership areas ($15-30/mo), advanced e-commerce features ($10-50/mo). A typical business using 5-7 premium apps might pay $50-150/month in app fees on top of Wix's $10-46/month base plan. Squarespace includes more features built-in without extra apps, which is why its pricing is higher upfront. For budgeting: Expect Wix to cost $10-50/month base + $0-150/month in apps depending on your needs. Squarespace costs $23-65/month with most features included. The break-even point is around 3-4 premium apps - beyond that, Squarespace's inclusive pricing becomes cheaper. Wix wins for users needing 0-2 apps. Squarespace wins for users needing 5+ apps."

        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Which platform is better for restaurants specifically: Wix or Squarespace?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "For restaurants, Wix often wins on value while Squarespace wins on design. Wix Restaurants includes online ordering, table reservations, delivery integration, and menu management - all built-in for $16-27/month. Squarespace creates stunning restaurant websites that make food photography look amazing, but reservations and online ordering require third-party integrations that cost extra ($20-50/month). Total cost comparison: Wix Restaurants = $16-27/month all-inclusive. Squarespace restaurant site = $23/month base + $29-49/month for reservations = $52-72/month total. The $25-45/month savings adds up to $300-540/year - real money for restaurants. If you're a high-end restaurant where design justifies premium pricing, Squarespace's visual polish may be worth it. For most restaurants operating on thin margins, Wix's included features and lower pricing make it the practical choice. Taste is visual, but restaurant websites are functional tools - reservations and orders matter more than aesthetics for most owners."

        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A restaurant owner needed a website. Menu, reservations, location, photos. Simple but professional. Budget: $30/month maximum.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The Squarespace route:</strong> Started 14-day trial. Built beautiful site in 4 hours. Restaurant templates were stunning - food photography looked amazing. But at $23/month, that left only $7/month for reservations system integration. Needed OpenTable integration - cost extra. Total: $23 + $29 = $52/month. Over budget.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The Wix route:</strong> Built site in 3 hours using Wix Restaurants template. Good but not Squarespace-level beautiful. But Wix Restaurants app included: online ordering, table reservations, delivery integration. All-in-one for $16/month (basic plan). Total: $16/month with everything included.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-purple-900 font-medium"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> Owner chose Wix. Why? "Squarespace site looked 20% better. But Wix has everything I need at $16/month vs. Squarespace's $52/month with add-ons. The visual difference isn't worth $36/month ($432/year)."</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-fuchsia-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Squarespace designs are undeniably more polished. But for small businesses with tight budgets, Wix's included features and lower pricing often win. Design is important, but $432/year in savings is real money for most businesses.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The framework:</strong> Choose Squarespace if design is your competitive advantage (designers, photographers, luxury brands). Choose Wix if you need specific features and have budget constraints. For restaurants specifically, Wix Restaurants is often the better value.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Is Wix or Squarespace better for website building?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Squarespace wins slightly overall (8.3/10 vs 8.2/10)</strong> with superior design quality (8.5/10 vs 8.0/10), faster loading speed (8.5/10 vs 8.0/10), and consistently polished templates that always look professional. Wix offers more features with its massive app marketplace (5000+ apps), more flexibility (7.5/10 vs 7.0/10), more affordable pricing starting at $10/month vs $23/month, and greater template variety (800+ vs 100+). Squarespace is better for: design-focused users wanting polished results, portfolios and visual brands, restaurants and creative businesses, users who prioritize design over features. Wix is better for: users needing specific features from apps, e-commerce with more options, complex websites requiring add-ons, budget-conscious users. Choose Squarespace for consistently polished design. Choose Wix for maximum features and flexibility.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">What is the price difference between Wix and Squarespace?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Wix and Squarespace have significantly different pricing structures with Wix being much more affordable at entry levels. Wix starts at $10/month for basic sites, $18/month for unlimited plans, up to $46/month for e-commerce and business features. Over 3 years, Wix costs $360-1656 depending on plan level. Squarespace starts at $23/month for personal websites, $33/month for business plans, up to $65/month for commerce features. Over 3 years, Squarespace costs $828-2340 depending on plan level. For basic websites, Wix is more than twice as affordable ($10 vs $23/month base pricing). For business features, the gap widens ($18 vs $33/month). Wix's more affordable pricing, combined with its extensive app marketplace, makes it better value for budget-conscious users. Squarespace's higher pricing reflects its design quality and polish - worth it for users prioritizing aesthetics. For most users, Wix provides better value while Squarespace justifies its premium with superior design.

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can I export code from Wix or Squarespace?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Neither Wix nor Squarespace offer code export - both platforms lock you into their hosting permanently. Your website stays on their servers and you're committed to their platform. This is different from competitors like Framer and Webflow which do offer code export on paid plans. With both Wix and Squarespace, you don't own your code and can't migrate to custom development or other hosting. If code export matters for your long-term strategy, consider Framer or Webflow instead. If you don't care about code export, both Wix and Squarespace are fine choices - just understand you're committing to their platforms. Platform lock-in is the trade-off for the convenience, features, and professional results these builders provide. For most users who just want a working website without technical complexity, this trade-off is acceptable. Choose based on features vs. design priorities, not code export.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Which is better for e-commerce: Wix or Squarespace?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Both Wix and Squarespace offer solid e-commerce, but they excel differently. Squarespace has beautiful, polished e-commerce templates that make products look professional. Built-in features include product management, inventory, discounts, shipping zones, and abandoned cart recovery. However, Squarespace e-commerce is more rigid - fewer customization options for product pages and checkout flows. Wix offers more e-commerce flexibility through its app marketplace. You can add advanced product filters, subscription billing, wholesale pricing, multi-vendor marketplaces, and complex shipping rules through apps. However, this requires installing and paying for multiple add-ons. For simple stores with standard products, Squarespace is easier and looks better. For complex e-commerce requiring custom functionality, Wix with apps offers more options. The trade-off: Squarespace is beautiful but rigid. Wix requires more setup but offers more customization. Budget also matters - Wix e-commerce starts cheaper, but adding apps can quickly exceed Squarespace pricing.

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Which platform loads faster: Wix or Squarespace?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            <strong>Squarespace generally loads faster</strong> (8.5/10 vs Wix's 8.0/10) due to optimized templates and cleaner code structure. Squarespace sites typically score 75-85 on Google PageSpeed Insights. Wix sites often score 65-75 due to heavier templates and app overhead. The speed difference comes from architecture: Squarespace templates are more streamlined with fewer dependencies. Wix allows more apps and customizations, which can slow down sites if overused. For most users, the difference is noticeable but not dramatic - both are decent. For mobile users and SEO-conscious sites, Squarespace has a speed advantage. However, Wix's speed varies significantly based on how many apps you install - a minimal Wix site can be fast, while a feature-heavy Wix site can be slow. If speed is critical for your use case (e.g., mobile-heavy audience, SEO priority), Squarespace has the edge. If you need features that justify a slight speed penalty, Wix is acceptable.

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do Wix apps cost extra and how much should I budget?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Yes, many Wix apps cost extra on top of your monthly subscription. Wix's app marketplace has 5000+ apps, and while some are free, premium apps typically cost $5-30/month each. Common app costs: Advanced booking systems ($15-29/mo), email marketing ($10-25/mo), enhanced forms ($5-15/mo), live chat ($10-20/mo), membership areas ($15-30/mo), advanced e-commerce features ($10-50/mo). A typical business using 5-7 premium apps might pay $50-150/month in app fees on top of Wix's $10-46/month base plan. Squarespace includes more features built-in without extra apps, which is why its pricing is higher upfront. For budgeting: Expect Wix to cost $10-50/month base + $0-150/month in apps depending on your needs. Squarespace costs $23-65/month with most features included. The break-even point is around 3-4 premium apps - beyond that, Squarespace's inclusive pricing becomes cheaper. Wix wins for users needing 0-2 apps. Squarespace wins for users needing 5+ apps.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Which platform is better for restaurants specifically: Wix or Squarespace?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            For restaurants, Wix often wins on value while Squarespace wins on design. Wix Restaurants includes online ordering, table reservations, delivery integration, and menu management - all built-in for $16-27/month. Squarespace creates stunning restaurant websites that make food photography look amazing, but reservations and online ordering require third-party integrations that cost extra ($20-50/month). Total cost comparison: Wix Restaurants = $16-27/month all-inclusive. Squarespace restaurant site = $23/month base + $29-49/month for reservations = $52-72/month total. The $25-45/month savings adds up to $300-540/year - real money for restaurants. If you're a high-end restaurant where design justifies premium pricing, Squarespace's visual polish may be worth it. For most restaurants operating on thin margins, Wix's included features and lower pricing make it the practical choice. Taste is visual, but restaurant websites are functional tools - reservations and orders matter more than aesthetics for most owners.
