            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Westfield Academy, K-12 private school in Seattle WA (established 2011). $25,000 annual tuition. Strong academics: 94% college placement, 12:1 student-teacher ratio. Website from 2012: broken on mobile, curriculum buried 6 clicks deep, no virtual tour, faculty listed as names only. 47 open seats despite strong academics. Competitor 2 miles away (same tuition, similar stats): beautiful Webflow site with curriculum pages, principal video, faculty bios with photos, event calendar prominent. They had a 40-family waitlist. Westfield's director: "We're better educators, but they win the enrollment game."</p>

Right platform showcases accreditation, explains programs clearly, demonstrates graduate success.

Choose based on: institution type (K-12 vs university vs training), program focus (academic vs vocational vs online), technical resources.

Testimonials with career transformation stories (Uber driver to software engineer 9 months later $120k salary promoted twice, single mom completed certificate promoted to manager now earning $80k bought first home) provide inspiration and proof that generic praise cannot match—enrollment increases 220% when life-changing results visible vs generic "learned a lot". Application process clarity (GPA requirements SAT scores deadlines clearly stated, steps outlined apply→documents→interview→decision) reduces anxiety and barriers to enrollment—conversion increases when process transparent vs hidden complexity. Learning resources accessible (sample lectures, downloadable syllabus, faculty bios) let prospective students experience quality before committing—engagement increases when prospective students can "try before they buy". Start with WordPress + LearnDash for flexibility and cost-effectiveness (50+ courses, 5000 active students, $5M annual revenue, 70% cost savings vs custom LMS), migrate to Finalsite when K-12 scale justifies investment (parent portals, student dashboards, parent communication tools increase engagement 80%, application conversion increases 60%), invest in custom Canvas integration for universities when seamless learning experience justifies $50k-200k investment (unified login SSO, course catalog auto-sync from LMS, student dashboard grades assignments resources increases student satisfaction 70%, reduces support calls 50%).</strong></p>

      <p class="text-xl">
        <strong>Choose WordPress (9/10) for most educational institutions.</strong> Multi-user management, flexible structure, plugin ecosystem for calendars/directories/portals. <span class="font-bold">Squarespace (8/10) for smaller visual-focused schools (art, music). Webflow (7/10) for design-forward programs wanting unique brand. Start with WordPress - you won't outgrow it.</span>
