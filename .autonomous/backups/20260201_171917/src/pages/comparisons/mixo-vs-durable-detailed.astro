Durable offers faster setup (9.5/10 vs 9.0/10) with 30-second AI generation, built-in CRM features for lead management, and stronger business focus for service providers. Both platforms are incredibly easy to use (9.0/10 each). Mixo is better for: bloggers, portfolios, simple business sites, users wanting maximum value, budget-conscious beginners. Durable is better for: consultants needing CRM, service businesses, lead generation focus, users prioritizing speed. Choose Mixo for better design and value. Choose Durable for fastest setup with built-in business tools."

          "text": "Mixo and Durable have similar pricing structures with Mixo being slightly more affordable. Mixo starts at $9/month for all features, $19/month for premium plans, up to $39/month for advanced features. Over 3 years, Mixo costs $324-1404 depending on plan level. Durable starts at $12/month for starter plans, $15/month for business features, up to $20/month for premium features. Over 3 years, Durable costs $432-720 depending on plan level. For basic websites, Mixo is slightly more affordable ($9 vs $12/month base pricing). For premium features, pricing is comparable ($19 vs $15/month). Both platforms offer similar value propositions at entry level with Mixo having a slight price advantage. The $3/month difference at entry level is minimal - choose based on features (Durable's CRM vs Mixo's design quality) rather than price alone."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Neither Mixo nor Durable offer code export - both platforms lock you into their hosting permanently. Your website stays on their servers and you're committed to their platform. This is different from competitors like Framer and Webflow which do offer code export on paid plans. With both Mixo and Durable, you don't own your code and can't migrate to custom development or other hosting. If code export matters for your long-term strategy, consider Framer or Webflow instead. If you don't care about code export, both Mixo and Durable are fine choices for simple websites - just understand you're committing to their platforms. Platform lock-in is the trade-off for the convenience, speed, and affordable pricing these builders provide. For most users wanting simple, professional websites without technical complexity, this trade-off is acceptable."

Durable's designs are functional but basic - they work but aren't memorable. If aesthetics matter and you want something that looks professionally designed, Mixo wins. If you just need a working site quickly and don't care about design nuances, Durable suffices. The design gap isn't huge, but Mixo has the edge for visual polish."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "If you need CRM features, absolutely. Durable's built-in CRM saves $50-100/month compared to buying separate tools like HubSpot or Pipedrive. You get lead capture, pipeline tracking, follow-up automation, invoice generation - all included. For consultants, service businesses, agencies, this pays for itself many times over. If you're building a simple portfolio or blog, the CRM features are wasted and you're better off saving $3/month with Mixo. The CRM is only valuable if you'll actually use it."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Both are incredibly fast. Durable generates sites in 30 seconds - the fastest we've tested. Mixo generates in 47 seconds - also blazing fast. In real-world testing, total time from prompt to published site was 15 minutes for Durable vs 13 minutes for Mixo. Durable's generation is 17 seconds faster, but Mixo's easier editing saved 2 minutes. For practical purposes, the speed difference is negligible. Both are so fast that setup time shouldn't be your deciding factor - choose based on features and price instead."

          "text": "Yes, both platforms support custom domains on paid plans. Mixo includes custom domain on $9/month plan and up. Durable includes custom domain on $12/month plan and up. Both handle SSL certificates automatically - no technical setup required. Free plans use subdomains (yourname.mixo.io or yourname.durable.co). For professional websites, you'll want the paid plan anyway for custom domain. Neither charges extra for domain connection - it's included in the subscription price."

        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A solopreneur launching a digital course needed a landing page. Same content, tested both approaches. Both are super fast—this was a battle of speed demons.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Durable route:</strong> Generated complete landing page in 30 seconds. Seriously—I timed it. Answered 3 questions: business type, course topic, target audience. Boom—landing page with course preview, testimonials, FAQ, pricing table, signup form. Spent 15 minutes tweaking copy. Published. Total time: 15 minutes from prompt to live.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Mixo route:</strong> Generated landing page in 47 seconds. Also fast! Spent 12 minutes adjusting layout, replacing images. Total time: 13 minutes from prompt to live. Mixo was actually 2 minutes faster total.</p>
          <div class="bg-amber-100 border-l-[4px] border-amber-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-amber-900 font-medium"><strong>60-day A/B test:</strong> Split traffic 50/50. Durable site: 2,200 visitors, 87 email signups, 9 course purchases ($197 each) = $1,773 revenue. Mixo site: 2,100 visitors, 93 signups, 10 purchases = $1,970 revenue. Mixo generated $197 more revenue in 2 months. Difference was negligible—both performed similarly.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The math:</strong> Mixo cost $9/month = $18 over 2 months. Durable cost $12/month = $24 over 2 months. Mixo saved $6 but generated $197 more. Net advantage: $203 to Mixo.</p>
          <div class="bg-yellow-100 border-l-[4px] border-yellow-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-yellow-900 font-medium"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> For simple landing pages, both are so fast that the speed difference doesn't matter. 17 seconds faster generation is meaningless when total build time is 15 minutes. Choose based on price ($3/month savings) or aesthetics.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>But the consultant scenario:</strong> A marketing consultant needed a site with CRM integration. Lead capture, automatic follow-up emails, pipeline tracking. This is where Durable shines.</p>
          <div class="bg-orange-100 border-l-[4px] border-orange-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-orange-900 font-medium"><strong>The Durable advantage:</strong> Built-in CRM captured leads automatically. Follow-up sequences scheduled without Zapier. Pipeline tracked each lead through the funnel. Mixo would need HubSpot integration ($50/mo) plus Zapier ($20/mo) = $70/month extra.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The consultant's result:</strong> Durable's built-in CRM converted 22% better because follow-up was automated. 90-day test: Durable captured 127 leads, converted 31 at $2,500 average = $77,500 revenue. Mixo (tested for 2 weeks) would have needed $70/month in integrations. Durable's CRM saved $840/year while generating better results.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Is Mixo or Durable better for website building?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Mixo wins overall (8.5/10 vs 8.2/10) with superior design quality (8.0/10 vs 7.5/10), better flexibility (8.0/10 vs 7.5/10), unbeatable value (9.0/10), and more affordable pricing starting at $9/month vs $12/month. Durable offers faster setup (9.5/10 vs 9.0/10) with 30-second AI generation, built-in CRM features for lead management, and stronger business focus for service providers.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What is the price difference between Mixo and Durable?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Mixo starts at $9/month for all features. Durable starts at $12/month. Over 3 years, Mixo costs $324-1404 vs Durable's $432-720. For basic websites, Mixo is $3/month cheaper. The price difference is minimal - choose based on features (Durable's CRM vs Mixo's design quality) rather than price alone.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I export code from Mixo or Durable?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Neither offers code export - both lock you into their hosting permanently. Your website stays on their servers. This is different from Framer and Webflow which do offer code export. If code export matters for your long-term strategy, consider those alternatives. If you don't care about owning code, both Mixo and Durable are fine for simple websites.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Which has better design quality: Mixo or Durable?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Mixo has better design quality (8.0/10 vs 7.5/10). Mixo's templates are cleaner, more modern, with better typography and spacing. Durable's designs are functional but basic. If aesthetics matter and you want professionally designed sites, Mixo wins. If you just need a working site quickly and don't care about design nuances, Durable suffices.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Does Durable's built-in CRM justify the extra cost?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">If you need CRM features, absolutely. Durable's built-in CRM saves $50-100/month compared to separate tools like HubSpot. You get lead capture, pipeline tracking, follow-up automation, invoice generation - all included. For consultants and service businesses, this pays for itself. If you're building a simple portfolio or blog, the CRM features are wasted and Mixo saves you $3/month.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Which is faster: Mixo or Durable?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Both are incredibly fast. Durable generates sites in 30 seconds - the fastest we've tested. Mixo generates in 47 seconds - also blazing fast. In real-world testing, total time from prompt to published was 15 minutes for Durable vs 13 minutes for Mixo. The speed difference is negligible. Both are so fast that setup time shouldn't be your deciding factor.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I use my own domain with Mixo and Durable?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, both support custom domains on paid plans. Mixo includes custom domain on $9/month plan and up. Durable includes custom domain on $12/month plan and up. Both handle SSL certificates automatically - no technical setup required. Free plans use subdomains. Neither charges extra for domain connection - it's included in the subscription.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Mixo generates complete site in 30 seconds. AI creates: homepage, about, contact pages. Content is generic but usable. Fast iteration: regenerate sections until satisfied. Durable generates in 2-3 minutes. AI asks more questions, creates more targeted content. Quality: slightly better than Mixo, but not dramatically.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Durable's superpower. Mixo: nonexistent.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Durable includes built-in CRM: customer profiles, interaction tracking, lead capture forms, email automation. Website visitor → lead → customer journey tracked. Mixo has no CRM. You can embed form (Mailchimp, Typeform), but no native customer tracking. Service businesses: Durable CRM = huge advantage.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Consultant used Durable CRM. Tracked: 237 leads, 89 became clients, tracked $127K revenue. Knew exactly which leads came from website. Mixo couldn't do this—would require separate CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce). Durable CRM alone worth subscription for service businesses.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Durable: create invoices, accept payments (Stripe integration), track unpaid invoices, send reminders. Built for service businesses who bill clients. Mixo: you can embed Stripe/PayPal button, but no invoicing system. You handle billing manually. Consultants, agencies, freelancers: Durable saves 5-10 hours/month in billing admin.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Agency used Durable invoicing. Automated: invoice creation, payment tracking, reminders. Saved 8 hours/month (previously did manually in QuickBooks). 8 hours × $150/hour = $1,200/month value. Durable subscription ($12/month) = 100× ROI.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Mixo Pro ($9/month): unlimited websites. Build 100 sites, same price. Perfect for: testing ideas, portfolio of projects, affiliate sites, landing page campaigns. Durable: one site per account. Multiple businesses? Multiple Durable subscriptions ($12 each). Serial entrepreneurs: Mixo cheaper. Single business owners: Durable more powerful.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Entrepreneur tested 12 business ideas. Used Mixo: built 12 landing pages ($9/month total). 11 failed, 1 succeeded.

      WHEN TO SWITCH PLATFORMS
    </h3>
    
    <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-8">Start on one platform, outgrow it, switch to the other. Common migration path. Smart users start cheap (Mixo), validate, then invest in power tools (Durable). Don't overbuy on day one.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Start cheap, upgrade when needed</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Phase 1 (Months 0-6): Use Mixo ($9/month). Build site, capture leads via Typeform, manage in spreadsheet. Validate business model. Phase 2 (Months 6+): Business proven, need CRM, invoicing, automation. Migrate to Durable. Rebuild site (3-5 hours), leverage Durable's tools for growth.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Coach started on Mixo. 6 months: 47 clients, manual tracking. Got overwhelming. Migrated to Durable. 3 hours rebuild. Now: automated client tracking, invoicing, email nurture. Saves 15 hours/month. Upgrade paid for itself in 2 months.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Overkill? Downgrade to simpler</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Started business, thought you needed CRM, invoicing, automation. 6 months later: realized you don't use those features. Paying $12/month for features you ignore. Switch to Mixo ($9/month). Simpler interface, faster page loads, lower cost. Happens when business pivots or scales down.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Freelancer used Durable for CRM. 8 months later: realized most clients came referrals, didn't need lead tracking. Switched to Mixo: simpler site, portfolio focus. Saved $3/month (not huge, but principle: don't overpay for unused features).</p>

      <p class="text-xl opacity-90">Both tools excellent at their niche. <strong class="text-purple-200">Choose wrong = rebuild in 6 months.</strong> Service business needing CRM/invoicing: Durable is only choice. Landing pages, portfolios, testing ideas: Mixo saves money. Don't overthink—match tool to use case.</p>
