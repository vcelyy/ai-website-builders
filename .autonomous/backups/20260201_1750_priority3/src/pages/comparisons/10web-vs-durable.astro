Durable (7.8/10) generates complete sites in 30 seconds with 95+ PageSpeed and zero technical knowledge required, but has no export, limited features, and no plugins. Choose Durable for speed and simplicity. Choose 10Web for e-commerce, content sites, and extensibility. If you need real e-commerce, 10Web is the only choice. If you need a simple site fast, Durable wins."

Your entire site (copy, images, layout, CRM data) is locked in Durable's platform. To move to 10Web/WordPress, you must rebuild from scratch. Real example: client spent $4,000 and 3 weeks rebuilding their site when they needed WordPress features Durable couldn't provide. If there's ANY chance you'll need e-commerce, memberships, content-heavy features—start with 10Web. The rebuild cost is brutal. Durable is perfect only if you're 100% sure you'll never need WordPress features."

It's more complex than Durable but far more powerful. For complete beginners, Durable (9.0/10 ease) is simpler. However, if you're willing to learn WordPress, 10Web gives you skills that transfer to 40% of all websites. WordPress knowledge is valuable long-term. Consider: Durable for zero learning curve, 10Web if you're willing to learn a valuable skill."

WooCommerce powers 38% of all online stores for a reason—it's powerful and flexible. Durable has only basic e-commerce. If you're selling products beyond simple items, 10Web is the only viable choice. For serious online stores with inventory management, product variants, or scaling needs, 10Web with WooCommerce is professional-grade."

This is significantly faster than 10Web's 75-85 PageSpeed and 2+ second load times. Durable's speed advantage comes from: optimized proprietary platform, minimal bloat, no plugin overhead, and aggressive caching. For local businesses, simple portfolios, and lead generation sites where speed directly impacts conversions, Durable's performance is excellent.

You cannot download your site, move to another host, or hire a developer to modify the code. This is the most significant limitation of Durable. If client handoff, potential exit, or platform independence matters, Durable is the wrong choice. 10Web exports standard WordPress—you can move to any host, hire any WordPress developer, or modify the code freely. Code export is critical for agencies, client work, or anyone who values ownership and portability."

At the high end, 10Web's premium plan ($60/mo) costs more but includes enterprise features. However, consider total cost of ownership: 10Web may require paid plugins for advanced features, while Durable includes everything. One client saved $1,200+ over 3 years using Durable instead of 10Web for a simple service business. Factor in your specific needs—both tools offer competitive pricing for their target use cases."

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Durable has basic e-commerce. 10Web has full WooCommerce—product variants, inventory, shipping zones, tax calculation, 60+ payment gateways. If you're selling products beyond simple items, 10Web is the only option.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Plugin ecosystem</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Need memberships? WordPress has plugins. Need advanced SEO? Yoast. Need forums? bbPress. 10Web gives you 20 years of WordPress innovation. Durable has whatever Durable built.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">You can export</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          10Web exports standard WordPress. Move to any host, hire any developer. Durable doesn't export at all—you're locked in permanently. If client work or potential exit matters, 10Web wins.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Content sites</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          For blogs, news sites, documentation—WordPress is purpose-built. Categories, tags, authors, comments, RSS, editorial workflow—all built-in. Durable can do blogs but it's not the primary focus.

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          30 seconds. That's not marketing—that's what I measured. Enter your business info, Durable generates complete site with sections, images, AI copy, forms, CRM. 10Web takes 30-60 seconds just for initial generation.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">PageSpeed</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          My test sites: Durable scored 98/100 on PageSpeed. 10Web scored 78/100. WordPress overhead is real. Durable is optimized for speed out of the box—no caching plugins, no optimization work needed.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Built-in CRM</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Durable includes a CRM that automatically captures leads from forms. 10Web requires external CRM tools or plugins. For lead gen and simple business sites, Durable's all-in-one approach is convenient.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Simplicity</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Durable requires zero technical knowledge. Generate, review, publish. 10Web requires understanding WordPress concepts—themes, plugins, widgets, updates. Non-technical users find Durable much friendlier.

              Durable doesn't export. Zero code export. The entire site—copy, images, layout, CRM data—was locked in Durable's platform. To move to WordPress, they had to rebuild from scratch.

              Hired a developer. Copy-pasted all content manually. Recreated layouts in Elementor. Migrated CRM data to a new system. Total cost: $4,000 in development fees. 3 weeks of work. Lost revenue during migration.

          <strong>The lesson:</strong> Durable is perfect if you know you'll never need WordPress features. But if there's ANY chance you'll need e-commerce, memberships, content-heavy features—start with 10Web. The rebuild cost is brutal.

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>Flip side:</strong> Another client built on 10Web three years ago. Still a simple service business. Never used the WordPress power. Paid 10Web hosting, dealt with plugin updates, managed backups. Could have saved $1,200+ with Durable's simpler approach.

          10Web and Durable solve different problems. 10Web gives you WordPress power—extensible, portable, familiar, but complex and slower. Durable gives you speed—30-second generation, 95+ PageSpeed, zero technical knowledge required, but limited.<br /><br />
          For local businesses, simple portfolios, lead gen sites—Durable is perfect. For e-commerce, content sites, anything complex—10Web is the only viable choice.

      <div class="border-l-4 border-[#F5521A] pl-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Which is better: 10Web or Durable?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">Neither is objectively better—they solve different problems. 10Web (8.2/10) is WordPress with AI generation—60,000 plugins, full WooCommerce e-commerce, code export, but requires WordPress knowledge and has slower PageSpeed (75-85). Durable (7.8/10) generates complete sites in 30 seconds with 95+ PageSpeed and zero technical knowledge required, but has no export, limited features, and no plugins. Choose Durable for speed and simplicity. Choose 10Web for e-commerce, content sites, and extensibility. If you need real e-commerce, 10Web is the only choice. If you need a simple site fast, Durable wins.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="border-l-4 border-[#F5521A] pl-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I switch from Durable to 10Web later?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">Switching from Durable to 10Web is difficult and expensive. Durable doesn't export code at all—zero code export. Your entire site (copy, images, layout, CRM data) is locked in Durable's platform. To move to 10Web/WordPress, you must rebuild from scratch. Real example: client spent $4,000 and 3 weeks rebuilding their site when they needed WordPress features Durable couldn't provide. If there's ANY chance you'll need e-commerce, memberships, content-heavy features—start with 10Web. The rebuild cost is brutal. Durable is perfect only if you're 100% sure you'll never need WordPress features.</p>

      <div class="border-l-4 border-[#F5521A] pl-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Is 10Web good for beginners?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">10Web is medium difficulty (7.0/10 ease). If you've never used WordPress, there's a learning curve. You'll learn WordPress themes, plugins, WooCommerce, updates, backups. It's more complex than Durable but far more powerful. For complete beginners, Durable (9.0/10 ease) is simpler. However, if you're willing to learn WordPress, 10Web gives you skills that transfer to 40% of all websites. WordPress knowledge is valuable long-term. Consider: Durable for zero learning curve, 10Web if you're willing to learn a valuable skill.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="border-l-4 border-[#F5521A] pl-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Does 10Web have good e-commerce?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">Yes, 10Web has excellent e-commerce through WooCommerce integration. You get full WooCommerce features: product variants, inventory management, shipping zones, tax calculation, 60+ payment gateways, discount codes, product reviews, and more. WooCommerce powers 38% of all online stores for a reason—it's powerful and flexible. Durable has only basic e-commerce. If you're selling products beyond simple items, 10Web is the only viable choice. For serious online stores with inventory management, product variants, or scaling needs, 10Web with WooCommerce is professional-grade.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="border-l-4 border-[#F5521A] pl-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How fast is Durable's PageSpeed?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">Durable delivers 95+ PageSpeed scores consistently. Sites load in under 1 second (0.9s in real testing). This is significantly faster than 10Web's 75-85 PageSpeed and 2+ second load times. Durable's speed advantage comes from: optimized proprietary platform, minimal bloat, no plugin overhead, and aggressive caching. For local businesses, simple portfolios, and lead generation sites where speed directly impacts conversions, Durable's performance is excellent. However, this speed comes at the cost of features—you're trading flexibility for performance.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="border-l-4 border-[#F5521A] pl-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Does Durable have code export?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">No, Durable does NOT offer any code export. Your website is permanently locked into Durable's platform. You cannot download your site, move to another host, or hire a developer to modify the code. This is the most significant limitation of Durable. If client handoff, potential exit, or platform independence matters, Durable is the wrong choice. 10Web exports standard WordPress—you can move to any host, hire any WordPress developer, or modify the code freely. Code export is critical for agencies, client work, or anyone who values ownership and portability.</p>

      <div class="border-l-4 border-[#F5521A] pl-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What does 10Web cost vs Durable?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">10Web pricing: $10-60/month depending on features and plan. Durable pricing: $15-20/month. At the low end, 10Web ($10/mo) is cheaper than Durable ($15/mo). At the high end, 10Web's premium plan ($60/mo) costs more but includes enterprise features. However, consider total cost of ownership: 10Web may require paid plugins for advanced features, while Durable includes everything. One client saved $1,200+ over 3 years using Durable instead of 10Web for a simple service business. Factor in your specific needs—both tools offer competitive pricing for their target use cases.</p>
