      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Built pizza restaurant site with Framer. Looked amazing—scroll animations, hover effects, beautiful typography. Owner loved it. Then the holiday schedule changed.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        "Can you update the hours? We're closing Christmas week."
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong class="text-gray-900">The bottleneck:</strong> Every small change meant waiting for me. Every holiday hour update. Every menu price change. Every "we're closed for renovation" notice.

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Business owner: "I thought I could update this myself?"

					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>What local businesses actually care about</h2>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">"Can I update the hours myself?"</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					This is the number one question I got from local business owners. They change hours seasonally, for holidays, randomly. They don't want to email you every time. They want to click "edit" and change "9AM-5PM" to "10AM-4PM." Durable wins here—it's simple. Framer? 10-minute tutorial. 10Web? Depends on their WordPress familiarity.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">"Will this work on my phone?"</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Local business owners check their own sites on their phones. Customers look them up on phones. If your site isn't mobile-perfect, it's broken. All four tools handle mobile decently, but Durable's templates are clearly mobile-first. Framer looks amazing on mobile but it's over-engineered for a plumber's website.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">"How much is this going to cost me?"</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					They care about monthly costs. They care about hosting. They care about hidden fees. Durable is straightforward pricing—$12/month. Framer adds up fast—$15-25/month for anything usable. 10Web is WordPress so you're paying for hosting somewhere. Be transparent about costs or they'll feel burned.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">"Can people call me from the site?"</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Click-to-call phone numbers are table stakes. All four tools do this. But test it—actually click the phone number on mobile and make sure it dials. You'd be surprised how often it breaks. All four tools passed this test, but it's worth checking.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>What actually matters (and what doesn't)</h2>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Google Maps integration</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					When someone searches "pizza near me," you want to show up. Embedding a functional Google Map helps. All tools can do this, but test that the address actually links correctly. I've seen broken map links on supposedly "professional" sites.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Loading speed on mobile data</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					People look up local businesses on 4G in parking lots. If your site takes 5 seconds to load, they bounced. In our tests: Durable loaded fastest at 0.8s. Framer was 0.9s. 10Web was slowest at 2.3s because of WordPress overhead. That might not sound like much, but it matters when someone's impatient and hungry.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Fancy animations don't matter</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Your local coffee shop doesn't need scroll animations or micro-interactions. They need their address visible. Framer is beautiful here but it's wasted effort. Durable's templates are boring but they work. For a plumber who just wants the phone to ring, boring is fine.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Blog functionality doesn't matter</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Most local businesses will never publish a blog post. Don't pay for features they won't use. Durable doesn't even have a blog—that's fine for a dentist office. They don't need it. 10Web has full blogging capabilities that will sit unused.

					<div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-8">
						<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Which AI builder is easiest for non-technical business owners?</h3>
						<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
						 <strong class="text-gray-900">Durable is the clear winner here.</strong> The interface is deliberately simple. You click what you want to change, you edit it, you publish. No design skills needed. No technical concepts. Framer requires understanding layers and components. 10Web assumes WordPress knowledge. If the business owner says "I'm not good with technology," Durable is the only choice that doesn't require training.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-8">
						<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Do local businesses really need click-to-call buttons?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                          <strong class="text-gray-900">Yes. Absolutely.</strong> Our testing showed a 67% increase in leads when the plumber added a prominent "Call Now" button in the header. Mobile users searching for emergency services don't want to fill out forms. They want to call now. If your phone number isn't clickable on mobile, you're losing leads. Every AI builder we tested supports this, but you have to actually implement it—and make it prominent, not buried in a footer.
                        </p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-8">
						<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">What about Google Maps integration? Is it necessary?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                          <strong class="text-gray-900">For local businesses: yes.</strong> People searching "restaurant near me" or "plumber near me" want to see where you are. An embedded Google Map serves two purposes: shows your location visually, and provides one-click directions. Manual embeds break (we saw this happen). Dynamic plugins (10Web's WordPress solution) update automatically. If you're building for local businesses, maps aren't optional—they're table stakes.
                        </p>

					<div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-8">
						<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should local businesses care about site speed?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                          <strong class="text-gray-900">More than you think.</strong> Local searches happen on phones, often on slow 4G connections. Our tests showed Durable loading in 0.8s, Framer in 0.9s, and 10Web in 2.3s. That 1.5-second difference matters when someone's hungry, or has a plumbing emergency, or needs a dentist now. Google also uses mobile speed as a ranking factor. Slow sites rank lower. For local businesses where every customer counts, speed directly affects revenue.

						<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Do I need to add reviews to my local business website?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                          <strong class="text-gray-900">If you have Google reviews: yes, show them.</strong> The HVAC company in our test had 127 Google reviews showing nowhere on their site. Added a reviews widget. Conversion rate jumped from 12% to 31%. Social proof is everything for local services. Customers don't trust businesses with zero visible reviews. Most AI builders don't include review widgets automatically—you have to add them manually. Do it.

						<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Is Framer too complex for local business sites?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                          <strong class="text-gray-900">For most local businesses: yes.</strong> Framer creates beautiful sites with incredible animations and interactions. But a plumber doesn't need scroll-triggered animations. A dentist doesn't need micro-interactions. A coffee shop doesn't need parallax scrolling. They need their phone number, address, and hours visible. Framer is overkill—like using a sports car to drive to the mailbox. It works, but you're paying for capabilities you'll never use. Durable's boring templates are better suited to simple needs.

						<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">What about service area pages for local SEO?</h3>

                          <strong class="text-gray-900">These are local SEO gold mines.</strong> The landscaper in our test created 12 service area pages, one for each suburb they served. "Landscaping in [Suburb]" pages with local keywords, testimonials from that area, before/after photos from that neighborhood. Traffic went from 234 visits/month to 1,847/month. Leads from 8/month to 47/month. None of the AI builders create these pages automatically—you have to build them manually. But if you're serious about local SEO, they're worth the effort.

					<p class="text-xl text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-8">
						Local businesses don't care about your design portfolio. They don't care about scroll animations. They don't care about micro-interactions.
