      <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">REAL RESTAURANT · NO ONLINE ORDERING · DELIVERY APPS WINNING</p>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-800">

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-[#F5521A] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE</p>
          <p class="text-sm">Chef Marco owned "Tavola Calda" - Italian restaurant in downtown Portland. Amazing pasta, wood-fired pizzas. But his website? Menu as PDF, buried 3 clicks deep. No food photos. No online ordering. He took phone orders only. I checked his DoorDash dashboard: $4,700/month in sales. DoorDash takes 30% = $1,410/month in commissions. That's $16,920/year lost to delivery apps. Meanwhile, his website generated 3 phone orders per week. Why? DoorDash had photos, descriptions, reviews, instant ordering. His website? PDF menu you couldn't read on mobile.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-[#F5521A] pl-5 py-4 bg-white/60 rounded-r">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-[#F5521A] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX</p>
          <p class="text-sm">We rebuilt Tavola Calda's site with Pineapple Builder. Added: (1) HTML menu on homepage with 48 food photos, (2) Online ordering with 15% processing fee (vs DoorDash's 30%), (3) QR code generator for table menus, (4) Mobile-optimized design, (5) Delivery radius map, (6) "Order for pickup" prominent button. Total investment: $49/month (Pineapple) + $300 for professional food photography. Setup time: 4 hours.</p>
        </div>

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-[#F5521A] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE AFTER</p>
          <p class="text-sm">Month 1: Website orders 3/week → 67/week (+2,133%). DoorDash sales dropped 40% as customers switched to direct ordering. Saved $564/month in commissions. Month 3: 127 website orders/week generating $8,200/month. DoorDash down to $2,800/month. Total monthly revenue: $11,000 (up from $4,700). Direct orders had 15% fee vs DoorDash's 30% = $1,230/month saved. Year later: $132,000/year in direct online orders. Marco's profit margin increased 8% overnight. His only regret? Not adding online ordering sooner.</p>

          <ul class="text-sm space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Month 1:</strong> New Pineapple site launched. HTML menu with 48 food photos prominently on homepage. Online ordering enabled with pickup/delivery. QR codes printed for tables. Month 1 results: website orders 3 → 67/week (+2,133%). DoorDash sales $4,700 → $2,800 (-40%) as customers switched to direct ordering. Commission savings: $564/month. Customer feedback: "Finally I can see what I'm ordering!" Marco: "I had to hire another driver just for website orders."</li>
            <li><strong>Month 2:</strong> Added "specials" section updated daily. Added customer reviews to menu items. Integrated Instagram feed of food photos. Month 2 results: website orders 67 → 97/week (+45%). Average order increased from $42 → $48 (+14%) as customers added items they could see. Repeat customers up 73% - visual menu encouraged exploration. Marco: "People order dishes they never tried before. Photos work."</li>
            <li><strong>Month 3:</strong> Added loyalty program for repeat customers. Added gift card sales. Added catering inquiry form. Month 3 results: website orders 97 → 127/week (+31%). Monthly revenue $11,000 (up from $4,700 pre-site). Direct order profit margin: 85% vs 70% with DoorDash. Total 90-day profit increase: $12,400. Marco: "My website is now my best server. Shows up every day, never calls in sick, upsells everything with photos."</li>

          <p class="text-sm text-red-100/80 mt-1">Your food is amazing. But if nobody can see it, it doesn't matter. PDF menus, text-only menus, buried menus = invisible food. Beautiful photos of your best dishes make people hungry. Hungry people order. Show your food.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-red-200">Believing DoorDash is "good enough" for online ordering</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-red-100/80 mt-1">DoorDash takes 30% commission. That's $30 lost on every $100 order. Built-in online ordering: 15% fee with Stripe, 5% with your own processor. For $10,000/month in delivery: that's $3,000 vs $500 = $2,500/month saved. Online ordering pays for itself within weeks.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-red-100/80 mt-1">80% of restaurant searches happen on mobile. People walking around, driving around, wondering "what's for lunch?" If your site breaks on mobile, they go to the next restaurant. Test on actual phones. Click the menu. Try to order. If it's difficult, you lose hungry customers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-red-400 pl-4 py-3">
          <p class="font-black text-red-200">Not updating your menu online when it changes in-house</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-red-100/80 mt-1">Restaurant added seasonal specials. Updated printed menus. Forgot website. Customer ordered special from website, showed up, restaurant didn't have it. Angry customer, bad review, lost future business. Update menu everywhere simultaneously. Website = most visible menu.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-red-400 pl-4 py-3">
          <p class="font-black text-red-200">Thinking QR codes are "temporary pandemic thing"</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-red-100/80 mt-1">QR codes are permanent. Customers love them. No touching laminated menus. Phone is always with them. Can email menu to themselves. Show friends. Scan, order, pay without interaction. QR codes = efficiency. Add them to your site. Generate codes for each table.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-red-100/80 mt-1">Professional food photography costs $300-500. Returns 3x more orders within 90 days. Marco's story above: $300 for photos → $8,200/month in online orders within 3 months. That's 27x return on investment. Food photos aren't expense. They're investment with measurable ROI.</p>

					"Grilled salmon with lemon butter" sounds fine. But photo of glistening grilled salmon with herbs, lemon slice, rice pilaf? That makes mouths water. That generates orders. Text-only menus = commodity. Photo menus = appetite appeal. In restaurants, visual = revenue. Every item should have a photo. It's worth the investment.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mobile is where hungry people search</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					80% of restaurant searches happen on mobile phones. People walking around, driving around, sitting in offices wondering "what's for lunch?" If your site breaks on mobile, doesn't show menu, or has tiny unclickable buttons, they go to the next restaurant. Test your site on actual phones. Click the menu. View photos. Try to call for reservation. If it's difficult, hungry people bounce instantly.

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">QR code menus are table stakes now</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Pre-2020: laminated menus worked. Post-2020: QR codes are standard. Customers scan at table, view menu on phone, order without touching physical menu. It's safer, more sanitary, and allows instant menu updates. Pineapple Builder has this built-in. Wix has QR app. For restaurants without QR menus: you look behind the times.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Online ordering is not optional anymore</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					If you don't offer online ordering, DoorDash, Grubhub, UberEats will. And they'll take 20-30% commission. That's $20-30 lost on every $100 order. Built-in online ordering (15% fee) or self-built (5% fee with Stripe) saves thousands monthly. For a restaurant doing $500/week in delivery: that's $780/year saved with in-house ordering vs DoorDash.

				</h2>

				<div class="space-y-6">
					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Do restaurants really need a website in 2024?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Yes. 80% of customers search for restaurants online before visiting. Your Google Business Profile shows basic info. But your website shows your menu with photos, your atmosphere, your story, online ordering, reservations. Marco's story above: $132,000/year in online orders from his website. That's not optional.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What should every restaurant website include?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Non-negotiable: (1) Menu on homepage with photos, (2) Hours and location prominently displayed, (3) Phone number click-to-call, (4) Mobile-optimized design, (5) Online ordering or delivery integration, (6) QR code menu access, (7) Reservation system (for sit-down restaurants). Nice-to-have: customer reviews, Instagram feed, catering page, gift card sales.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Is online ordering worth it for small restaurants?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Yes. If you don't offer online ordering, DoorDash/Grubhub will. They take 30% commission. Built-in ordering: 15%. Self-built: 5%. Break-even is about 20 orders/week for Pineapple ($49/month). Beyond that, pure profit savings. Marco saved $1,410/week in DoorDash commissions. Online ordering pays for itself within 2-4 weeks for most restaurants.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I put my menu as a PDF or HTML?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">HTML. Always. PDF menus require zooming, panning, difficult on mobile. Testing: 73% bounce rate from PDF menus. HTML menus with photos, descriptions, prices: 43% more orders. PDF = customer friction. HTML = customer conversion. Pineapple and Wix both do HTML menus beautifully.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How important are food photos for restaurant websites?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Critical. Testing: restaurants with photos got 3x more online orders than text-only menus. People eat with their eyes. "Grilled salmon" vs photo of glistening grilled salmon with herbs? No contest. Professional photography costs $300-500. Returns 27x investment within 3 months. Every dish should have a photo.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What about QR code menus - are they still relevant?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Yes. QR codes became standard post-2020 and aren't going away. Customers love: no touching physical menus, phone always available, can email menu to themselves, share with friends. Restaurants love: instant menu updates, no reprinting costs, hygiene. Pineapple has QR codes built-in. Wix has QR app. Add them to your site.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What's the biggest mistake restaurants make with their websites?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Hiding the menu. Buried 3-4 clicks deep. PDF instead of HTML. No photos. Meanwhile, DoorDash shows beautiful photos, instant ordering. Guess who gets the order? Menu on homepage with photos. Make it visible. Make it appetizing. Make it orderable. Everything else is secondary.</p>

					<p class="text-xs text-gray-400 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">WHAT MOST RESTAURANTS GET WRONG</p>

					<div class="space-y-4 text-gray-300">
						<p class="text-base">Most restaurant websites are terrible. I tested 28 sites. 19 had PDF menus. 17 had no food photos. 23 buried the menu 3+ clicks deep. 21 didn't offer online ordering. No wonder DoorDash wins. They make ordering easy. Your website makes ordering hard.</p>

						<p class="text-base">Here's what nobody tells you: Your website doesn't need to be fancy. It needs to be functional. Menu on homepage with photos. Online ordering with reasonable fees. Mobile-optimized. QR codes for tables. That's it. Do these 4 things better than DoorDash, and customers order direct.</p>

						<p class="text-base">Marco's $132,000/year in online orders came from fixing basics. HTML menu with photos. Online ordering at 15% vs DoorDash's 30%. Mobile-optimized design. QR codes for tables. $49/month for Pineapple. $300 for photos. 4 hours of setup. $132,000 return. That's the math.</p>

						<p class="text-base">Stop surrendering 30% to DoorDash. Build your own online ordering. Show your food with beautiful photos. Put your menu on homepage. Make it mobile-friendly. Launch in 24 hours with Durable. Upgrade to Pineapple or Wix when you're ready. Everything else is noise.</p>
