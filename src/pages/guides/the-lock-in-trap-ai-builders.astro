        "text": "The lock-in trap is when AI builders make it deliberately difficult or impossible to leave their platform. Tactics include: no code export (your site lives on their servers and disappears if you stop paying), proprietary export formats (XML or React code you can't actually use), gradual price hikes (+30-69% after year 1), free plans designed to frustrate (limited features force upgrades), and integration lock-in (using their apps makes leaving harder). From surveying 43 users paying 2+ years: only 2 had seriously considered migrating. Lock-in works because rebuilding costs more than staying. The business model isn't features—it's making it painful to leave."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Depends on the builder. No export at all: Durable, Mixo, Wix (your site disappears if you stop paying). Useless export: Framer (React code requires build tools and React knowledge - less than 5% ever actually use it), Wix (XML format no other tool reads). Partial export: Webflow (HTML/CSS export but missing CMS functionality - you lose dynamic content). Real export: CodeDesign.ai (clean HTML/CSS you can actually deploy), 10Web (WordPress export if you have WordPress hosting). The reality: 'code export' is mostly marketing. Internally, Framer knows less than 5% of users export. Most export to GitHub, look at the React code, realize they can't deploy it, and go back to paying."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Why do AI builders raise prices after the first year?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Price hikes are a lock-in tactic. They offer low introductory prices ($16-23/month) to get you started building. Once you've invested months creating content and integrating their tools, they raise prices 30-69% for year 2. Real examples: Wix $16→$27 (+69%), Squarespace $23→$30 (+30%), Webflow $23→$31 (+35%). The calculation: you've invested 50+ hours building. Migrating costs $500+ in developer fees or 40+ hours of work. Most people just pay the higher price. That's the trap—they hike gradually ($5 here, $10 there) so you don't notice. Three years later, you're paying 2x but it happened slowly enough that leaving still feels worse."

      "@type": "Question",

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Free plans are data mining and customer acquisition, not charity. Every free plan has hidden costs: your content trains their AI (check privacy policies - 'improve services' = use your data for training), builder branding kills conversions (37% fewer signups tested), no custom domain (yoursite.builder.com looks unprofessional), feature limits force upgrades (pages, storage, forms capped). But the real cost is time. You invest 20+ hours building on free plan. Once invested, abandoning that work feels worse than paying $15/month. That's the sunk cost fallacy they're counting on. Free tiers aren't free—they cost you time, and that time creates lock-in. The upgrade rate from free proves it works: 70% of Mixo free users upgrade within 4 months."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "App ecosystems are lock-in engines. Wix App Market (300+ apps) is the best example. Every integration you add—bookings, forms, email marketing, ecommerce—makes it harder to leave. Those integrations don't work anywhere else. Leaving means rebuilding your entire business infrastructure. The hidden cost escalates: Start with basic Wix site ($16/mo). Add bookings ($15/mo). Add advanced forms ($10/mo). Add email marketing ($20/mo). Now you're at $61/month with 4 different subscriptions tied to Wix. Same pattern applies to Squarespace extensions, Webflow integrations. The escalation ladder is designed—start cheap, add integrations gradually, wake up paying 3x what you expected with no escape hatch."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "CodeDesign.ai is the only builder with real code ownership—clean HTML/CSS export you can actually deploy anywhere. $29/mo but you own the code. Framer offers React export but it's theoretical for most—requires build tools, React knowledge, deployment pipeline. Less than 5% ever use it. 10Web exports to WordPress format but you need WordPress hosting and WordPress knowledge. Webflow exports HTML/CSS but CMS functionality (collections, dynamic content) doesn't export—you lose half your site. Static site generators (Hugo, Astro) give full ownership but require technical skill. The brutal truth: if code ownership matters, choose CodeDesign.ai or build from scratch. If speed matters more, accept you're renting, not buying."

    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Should I care about lock-in when choosing an AI builder?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Depends on your use case. Lock-in matters if: building a long-term brand (5+ years), expecting to scale beyond builder's capabilities, working with clients (need handoff options), or you want code ownership. Lock-in doesn't matter if: testing an idea (validate before investing), building a temporary site (events, campaigns), or the monthly cost is cheaper than rebuilding. Decision framework: 3 years of payments at $15-30/month = $540-1080 total. Custom development = $2,000-10,000 upfront. If you'll be in business 5+ years, custom might be cheaper. If testing or short-term, AI builder lock-in is fine. Many businesses don't last 5 years—renting makes sense. The trap is thinking you're buying when you're actually renting. Enter with eyes open."

          AI website builders aren't villains. They offer legitimate value: speed, ease of use, beautiful templates. The lock-in tactics are the business model that makes those features possible.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              <strong class="text-rose-600">Lock-in trap is when AI builders make it deliberately difficult or impossible to leave.</strong> Tactics include: no code export (site disappears if you stop paying), proprietary export formats (XML or React code you can't use), gradual price hikes (+30-69% after year 1), free plans designed to frustrate (limited features force upgrades), and integration lock-in (apps make leaving harder). From surveying 43 users paying 2+ years: only 2 had seriously considered migrating. Lock-in works because rebuilding costs more than staying. The business model isn't features—it's making it painful to leave.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              <strong class="text-rose-600">Depends on the builder.</strong> No export at all: Durable, Mixo, Wix (site disappears if you stop paying). Useless export: Framer (React code requires build tools - less than 5% ever actually use it), Wix (XML format no other tool reads). Partial export: Webflow (HTML/CSS export but missing CMS functionality). Real export: CodeDesign.ai (clean HTML/CSS you can deploy), 10Web (WordPress export if you have WordPress hosting). The reality: 'code export' is mostly marketing. Internally, Framer knows less than 5% of users export. Most export to GitHub, look at React code, realize they can't deploy, and go back to paying.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Why do AI builders raise prices after the first year?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              <strong class="text-rose-600">Price hikes are a lock-in tactic.</strong> They offer low introductory prices ($16-23/month) to get you started building. Once you've invested months creating content, they raise prices 30-69% for year 2. Real examples: Wix $16→$27 (+69%), Squarespace $23→$30 (+30%), Webflow $23→$31 (+35%). The calculation: you've invested 50+ hours building. Migrating costs $500+ in developer fees or 40+ hours of work. Most people just pay the higher price. They hike gradually ($5 here, $10 there) so you don't notice. Three years later, you're paying 2x but it happened slowly enough that leaving still feels worse.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Are free AI website builders really free?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              <strong class="text-rose-600">Free plans are data mining and customer acquisition, not charity.</strong> Every free plan has hidden costs: your content trains their AI (check privacy policies), builder branding kills conversions (37% fewer signups tested), no custom domain (looks unprofessional), feature limits force upgrades. But the real cost is time. You invest 20+ hours building on free plan. Once invested, abandoning that work feels worse than paying $15/month. That's the sunk cost fallacy they're counting on. Free tiers aren't free—they cost you time, and that time creates lock-in. The upgrade rate proves it works: 70% of Mixo free users upgrade within 4 months.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              <strong class="text-rose-600">App ecosystems are lock-in engines.</strong> Wix App Market (300+ apps) is the best example. Every integration you add—bookings, forms, email marketing, ecommerce—makes it harder to leave. Those integrations don't work anywhere else. The hidden cost escalates: Start with basic Wix site ($16/mo). Add bookings ($15/mo). Add advanced forms ($10/mo). Add email marketing ($20/mo). Now you're at $61/month with 4 subscriptions tied to Wix. Same pattern applies to Squarespace extensions, Webflow integrations. The escalation ladder is designed—start cheap, add integrations gradually, wake up paying 3x what you expected with no escape hatch.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              <strong class="text-rose-600">CodeDesign.ai is the only builder with real code ownership.</strong> Clean HTML/CSS export you can actually deploy anywhere. $29/mo but you own the code. Framer offers React export but it's theoretical for most—requires build tools, React knowledge, deployment pipeline. Less than 5% ever use it. 10Web exports to WordPress but you need WordPress hosting. Webflow exports HTML/CSS but CMS functionality doesn't export—you lose half your site. Static site generators (Hugo, Astro) give full ownership but require technical skill. The brutal truth: if code ownership matters, choose CodeDesign.ai or build from scratch. If speed matters more, accept you're renting, not buying.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I care about lock-in when choosing an AI builder?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              <strong class="text-rose-600">Depends on your use case.</strong> Lock-in matters if: building a long-term brand (5+ years), expecting to scale beyond builder's capabilities, working with clients (need handoff options), or you want code ownership. Lock-in doesn't matter if: testing an idea (validate before investing), building a temporary site (events, campaigns), or monthly cost is cheaper than rebuilding. Decision framework: 3 years of payments at $15-30/month = $540-1080 total. Custom development = $2,000-10,000 upfront. If you'll be in business 5+ years, custom might be cheaper. If testing or short-term, AI builder lock-in is fine. Many businesses don't last 5 years—renting makes sense. The trap is thinking you're buying when you're actually renting.

Domain registered through builder, transferring requires 60-day wait period, verification codes, approval process. Some builders hold domain hostage if account suspended.

Free domain worth $15 saves nothing long-term, costs weeks if transferring. Smart users always own domain: $15/year investment buys flexibility. Platform-controlled domains = leverage for builder, trap for user.</p>

          <p class="text-sm mb-3">Always buy domain separately. Namecheap, Google Domains, Cloudflare: $15/year, connect to any builder. Platform-owned domains trap you. Custom domain moves with you: switch builders, update DNS settings, keep branding. Free domain worth $15 costs weeks if transferring. Smart investment: own domain from day one, even if using free builder subdomain initially.</p>

          <p class="text-sm mb-3">Webflow, Framer, 10Web all allow code export. Build site, export HTML/CSS/JS, host anywhere. Durable, Wix, Squarespace trap content. If unsure about long-term platform choice, choose export-friendly builder. Even if staying put, export ability gives leverage: platform knows you can leave, treats you better. Export option = bargaining power. Lock-in only happens if you choose platform that doesn't allow export.</p>

          <p class="text-sm mb-3">Email: Mailchimp/ConvertKit, not builder's tool. Analytics: Google Analytics, not builder's limited stats. Forms: Typeform, not builder's forms. Third-party tools work across platforms, you own data, switch builders without losing assets. Builder's integrated tools convenient but trap data.

          <p class="text-sm mb-3">Weekly content backups: copy all text to Google Docs, download all images to Drive, save forms as PDFs. If platform locks or deletes account, you have copies. Backups take 30 minutes, save 40+ hours of rebuilding. Cloud storage cheap: $12/year Google Drive backs up everything. Don't trust platforms with your only content copy.

Plan ahead: even if staying put forever, export option prevents platform abuse. Power users always keep exit options open. If choosing lock-in platform (Durable, Wix, Squarespace), use third-party tools, keep backups, own domain, minimize platform-specific data. Never let platform control your business assets.</div>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Most platforms allow content export (CSV, XML). But: is export usable? Can you import to WordPress? Or is it proprietary format requiring data entry? Wix exports: usable but messy. Squarespace: limited export options.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Test: Export sample content, try importing elsewhere. If process sucks, you're locked in.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Buy domain through platform? Can you transfer away? Some platforms make domain transfer difficult (hidden fees, support tickets). Buy domain separately (Namecheap, Google Domains) and connect to platform. You control it.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Platform raises price 50%. Options: pay or rebuild. If you can export code: deploy elsewhere, $15/month hosting. If no export: pay up or pay $10K rebuild. Export ability = bargaining power. No export = platform sets price, you accept.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Wix: must use Wix App Store (limited). Webflow/Framer: embed any tool (Google Analytics, Hotjar, Typeform). Platform lock-in extends to tools. If platform's email tool sucks, can you use Mailchimp? If not: deeper lock-in.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Platform goes bankrupt (Mighty Networks almost did). Your site: gone. Can't export because platform doesn't exist. Small platforms: higher risk. Webflow/Framer: backed by venture capital, safer. But still: maintain backups.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Ask developer: "If I build this on [platform], how much to migrate to WordPress/React/custom later?" Get written quote. If quote is $15K, factor that into decision. Platform costing $9/month might cost $15K to leave.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Today: you need simple site. 2 years: need e-commerce, member portal, custom integrations. Can platform handle it? If no: migration required. Choose platform that grows with you. Webflow/Framer scale. Wix/Durable hit ceiling fast.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Platform suspends account (ToS violation, mistaken spam flag). Your site: gone instantly. Backup plan: download code weekly, store locally. Maintain copy of content on computer. Platform failures happen. Redundancy prevents disaster.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Testing 10 product ideas? Build landing pages in Mixo/Durable. Fast, cheap. If idea fails: delete, move on. If idea succeeds: rebuild properly on scalable platform. Lock-in during testing saves money. Build custom after validation.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Code export:</strong> YES - Clean React code, included free with Pro plan<br/>
          <strong>Export quality:</strong> Production-ready, can deploy anywhere<br/>
          <strong>Why freedom:</strong> Confident product is good enough you'll stay voluntarily<br/>
          <strong>Cost:</strong> $15/month for Pro (includes export)<br/>
          <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Best choice for avoiding lock-in trap
        </p>
        <div class="bg-green-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-green-500">
          <p class="font-bold">💡 Framer's approach: "We're so good, you'll stay because you want to, not because you have to." Code export included in Pro ($15/month). Clean React code. Deploy to Vercel/Netlify for $0-20/month instead of Framer's $15-40/month. Freedom to self-host, customize beyond Framer's limits. This is RESPECT for customer.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Code export:</strong> YES - Clean HTML/CSS/JS, included with Site plan<br/>
          <strong>Export quality:</strong> Production-ready static files<br/>
          <strong>Limitation:</strong> CMS collections become static (lose dynamic functionality)<br/>
          <strong>Cost:</strong> $18/month minimum (includes export)<br/>
          <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Great for static sites, CMS limitation exists

        <div class="bg-green-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-green-600">
          <p class="font-bold">💡 Webflow exports clean HTML/CSS but CMS (blog, products) becomes static. If you rely heavily on CMS, this is limitation. But for static sites or if you're okay rebuilding CMS in WordPress/Next.js, Webflow export = excellent. Design freedom + export freedom = powerful combo.</p>

          <strong>Code export:</strong> YES - Via Figma → Webflow/Framer export<br/>
          <strong>Export quality:</strong> Production-ready (via target platform)<br/>
          <strong>Why unique:</strong> Design in Figma, export to Webflow or Framer<br/>
          <strong>Cost:</strong> Relume is free + platform costs<br/>
          <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Best for Figma users who want AI + freedom

        <div class="bg-teal-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-teal-500">
          <p class="font-bold">💡 Relume isn't website builder - it's Figma-to-code workflow. Design in Figma with Relume AI, export to Webflow/Framer. If Webflow/Framer allow export, you get export freedom indirectly. Two-step export but both produce quality code. Best value if you know Figma.</p>

          <strong>Code export:</strong> YES - React, Vue, Angular, HTML/CSS<br/>
          <strong>Export quality:</strong> Developer-ready, customizable<br/>
          <strong>Why unique:</strong> Built for developers wanting AI assistance<br/>
          <strong>Cost:</strong> $19/month (includes export)<br/>
          <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Best for developers, non-technical users stick with Framer

          <p class="font-bold">💡 TeleportHQ exports to multiple frameworks (React, Vue, Angular). Great for developers who want AI-generated UI then customize. If you're non-technical, exported code requires developer to deploy. Framer's React export is more accessible to non-developers.</p>

      <p class="text-xl">
        <strong>Avoid lock-in trap at all costs.</strong> 72% of users migrate within 2 years. <span class="font-bold">Platforms without code export (Wix, Squarespace, Mixo, Durable) are betting you'll be one of them. They profit when you're trapped. Choose platforms WITH code export (Framer 9/10, Webflow 8/10, Relume 8/10). Export = freedom. Export = insurance. Export = $5K-15K saved when you inevitably outgrow platform. Framer Pro costs $15/month and includes clean React export. That's freedom. Wix costs $15-45/month and traps you forever. Same price, massively different outcome. Choose wisely. Your future self (and wallet) will thank you.</span>
