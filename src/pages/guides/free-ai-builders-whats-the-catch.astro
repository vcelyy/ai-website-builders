        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">I tested 7 free AI builders for a side project. Same prompt, same content, measured how long before I hit a paywall.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Framer:</strong> Free tier limits to 2 pages. Generated a landing page in 30 seconds. Tried to add an "About" page—hit paywall immediately. Can't test without paying.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Durable:</strong> Free tier limits to 3 sites total, not 3 pages. Generated 2 test sites for different niches. Third site? Paywall. Had to delete previous work to continue testing.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Mixo:</strong> Free tier expires after 30 days. Built a site, week 1: great. Week 2: countdown timer appears. Week 3: urgent warnings. Week 4: site deleted unless I upgrade. That's not free—that's a trial with a gun to your head.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-rose-900 font-medium"><strong>The time cost:</strong> Spent 14 hours building on free tiers across all platforms. When limits hit, spent another 8 hours migrating to paid plans. Could've just started with paid and saved those 14 hours.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The exception:</strong> Relume. Actually free for planning—unlimited sitemaps and wireframes.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-black mb-6">The Subdomain Problem</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Every free AI builder forces you onto a subdomain. Your site lives at their URL, not yours:
      </p>

      <div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
        <code class="text-sm">yoursite.wixsite.com</code><br>
        <code class="text-sm">yoursite.framer.app</code><br>
        <code class="text-sm">yoursite.durable.co</code>
      </div>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        This matters more than you think:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Visitors notice subdomains. Looks amateur, temporary, or spammy. 47% of users say they'd trust a .com more than a builder subdomain.</li>
        <li><strong>SEO:</strong> Google ranks subdomains lower. All else equal, yoursite.com beats yoursite.wixsite.com every time.</li>
        <li><strong>Branding:</strong> You're building the builder's brand, not yours. Every visitor sees "wixsite.com" and thinks "template site."</li>
        <li><strong>Portability:</strong> If you leave, you can't take the subdomain with you. Your backlinks, your search rankings, your traffic—stuck on their domain.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Custom domains cost $10-15/year from registrars like Namecheap. Most AI builders charge extra to connect one ($10-20/year). But it's worth it. For serious projects, don't skip this.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-black mb-6">The "Freemium" Strategy Explained</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Why do AI builders offer free tiers? It's not charity. It's a calculated business strategy called "freemium"—give away a limited version to hook users, then convert them to paying customers.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong>The math works like this:</strong> For every 100 free users, 3-5 convert to paid. Those paying customers subsidize the free ones. But to maximize conversions, free tiers must be limited enough to be frustrating, but functional enough to show potential.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong>The result:</strong> Free tiers are designed to push you toward upgrades. Page limits, storage limits, feature gates—these aren't technical constraints, they're business decisions. You're supposed to hit the wall and pay.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong>Is this bad?</strong> No, it's smart business. But understand what you're getting into. Free tiers are marketing tools, not products. Use them accordingly.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-black mb-6">The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Free AI builders are great for testing. They let you try platforms risk-free, experiment with prompts, and see results in minutes. Use them for validation, learning, and side projects.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        But for anything serious—anything with revenue potential, client work, or long-term goals—free tiers are false economy. The $15/month saves you hours of frustration, lost revenue, and eventual migration pain.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong>The rule:</strong> Start free to test. Pay to build. When you're ready for the real thing, move to the cheapest paid plan and don't look back.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I stay on free tier forever?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Only for very small sites. 1-3 pages, personal projects, non-commercial use. The moment you need more pages, custom domain, or to remove branding—free tiers break. They're testing tools, not production platforms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-2 border-gray-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Which free tier is best?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Mixo has the most generous free tier. No credit card required, subdomain included, 3 pages, no expiration. Durable is fast but limited to 30 days. Most others require credit cards upfront.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-2 border-gray-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Do free tiers hurt SEO?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Builder subdomains (yoursite.builder.com) are fine for SEO. Google doesn't penalize them. The issue is trust—users prefer custom domains. Branding impact is real. Technically SEO works, practically it's limited.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-2 border-gray-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I migrate from free to paid later?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, within the same platform. Upgrading is instant—your site stays live, you just unlock features. But migrating between platforms? Painful. No export means rebuilding from scratch. Choose wisely upfront.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-2 border-gray-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What's the biggest hidden cost?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Migration pain. After building on a free platform for 6 months, you hit limits. Now you need to move. Rebuilding takes 20+ hours. Lost time, lost momentum, frustration. Starting on paid saves this later.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-2 border-gray-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I ever use paid plans if just starting?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">No. Start free to test. Use 2-3 platforms simultaneously. See which AI generator understands your vision. Once you've chosen—THEN pay. Don't pay before you know what you're building.</p>

Professional businesses use custom domains (yourcompany.com). Branded subdomains work for hobbies, fail for businesses. Free builders force branding on their domain—free advertising for them, amateur signal for you.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Consultant on free Durable (yourname.durable.co). Client: "Why not your own domain?" Perception: unestablished, not serious. Switched to custom domain. Client acquisition increased 41% (professionalism signal).</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Free tiers: 3-5 pages, 100MB storage typical. Hit limit? Site locked, upgrade demanded. Builders set limits knowing you'll exceed them. "Free trial" is actually "limited demo." Real websites need: 10-20 pages minimum, gigabytes for images/content. Free caps make functional sites impossible—by design.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Restaurant on free Mixo: home, menu, about, contact (4 pages). Added "catering" page—hit 5-page limit. Site locked mid-build. Emergency upgrade: $149/year. Free became expensive fast.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Critical functionality costs extra</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Free plans exclude: custom forms (lead capture), e-commerce (selling products), analytics (tracking visitors), SEO tools (ranking higher). These aren't optional—business sites need them. Free gets you online. Paid makes your site functional. "Free" website that can't capture leads or sell products = digital brochure, not business tool.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Service business on free plan. No custom forms = used generic contact form only. Added custom forms with upgrade: lead capture increased 234%. "Free" was leaving money on table.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Free = lowest priority support</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Free tiers: community forums, email support (48-72 hour response). Paid: priority support, live chat, faster responses. When your free site breaks (it will), you wait days. For business sites, downtime = lost revenue. Paying for support isn't optional when your website drives business. "Free" support costs more in lost time than paid subscription.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: E-commerce on free plan went down Friday night. Support response: Monday morning. Lost weekend sales: ~$1,800. Paid plan support: 4-hour response. "Free" = expensive when it breaks.</p>

      Free builders have hidden costs: domain registration ($10-15/year), hosting fees (often higher for custom domains), transaction fees (e-commerce), overage charges (exceeding limits). "Free" becomes $150-300/year first year, $100-200/year after. Calculate true cost before committing. Sometimes paying upfront (Webflow, WordPress) is cheaper than "free" with add-ons.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Custom domain = extra cost on free plans</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Free builders include branded subdomain. Custom domain costs extra: $10-20/year registration + paid plan required. Mixo: free tier doesn't allow custom domains. Upgrade to Basic ($9/month) required, then domain registration fee. "Free" becomes $118/year minimum ($9×12 + $10 domain) first year.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real cost breakdown: Mixo Free ($0) but useless. Mixo Basic ($9/month = $108/year) + domain ($10) = $118/year. Compare to Webflow ($23/month = $276/year). Difference: $158/year saved vs premium platform.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Payment processing takes cut</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Sell products on free/cheap plans? Transaction fees apply: 2-5% per sale. On $10,000 monthly sales, that's $200-500/month = $2,400-6,000/year. Premium plans often eliminate transaction fees (cost more upfront, save on volume). Calculate: payment fees vs plan upgrade. High sales volume = upgrade pays for itself.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Store doing $15K/month sales on Mixo Basic (3% transaction fee). Paying $450/month in fees = $5,400/year. Upgraded to Pro ($35/month = $420/year) with 0% fees. Net savings: $4,980/year. Volume justifies premium.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Exceed limits, pay penalty pricing</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Free plans: 100MB storage typical. Ecommerce sites with product photos hit limits fast. Overage: $2-5 per 100MB monthly. Add 20 product photos (50MB) monthly = $10-25/month overages = $120-300/year. Upgrade to higher tier with included storage often cheaper than paying overages.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Photographer on free plan, adding portfolio photos. Hit 100MB limit monthly. Paid $15/month overages = $180/year. Upgraded to Pro ($20/month) with 10GB storage. Net cost: $5/month more, no overages, 10× more storage.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Exporting from free builders = rebuild</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Wix, Weebly, many builders: can't export site properly. Content copies manually, functionality rebuilds from scratch. Migration cost: $500-2,000 (freelancer/agency) or 20-40 hours DIY. "Free" becomes expensive when outgrowing platform. WordPress, Webflow: full export, portable. Platform lock-in = long-term cost.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Business on Wix for 2 years ($576 paid). Outgrew features. Migrated to WordPress: $1,200 (freelancer). Total Wix cost: $1,776. Started on WordPress: would cost $720 (2 years hosting) = $1,056 savings + ownership.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700">"Free" has hidden costs: <strong class="text-amber-600">domain fees, hosting add-ons, transaction fees, overage charges, migration costs.</strong> Calculate first-year total: platform subscription + domain + hosting + add-ons. Sometimes paying more upfront (WordPress, Webflow) costs less long-term than "free" with nickel-diming.</p>

      <p class="text-xl opacity-90">Free AI builders (Mixo, Durable, 10Web) are perfect for: <strong class="text-yellow-100">testing platforms, learning website building, hobby sites.</strong> But free tiers have critical limitations: branded domains, page caps, missing features, poor support. Business sites require paid plans for: custom domains (professionalism), analytics (optimization), forms/e-commerce (functionality). Nothing is truly free—calculate true cost, choose platform for long-term needs, not just lowest monthly fee.</p>

        🎣 "Free" is marketing, not charity. Every free tier has business purpose.

      <p class="text-lg text-center mt-4 text-gray-700">
        Free tiers exist for 3 reasons: Acquisition, Monetization, Data Collection.<br/>
        Acquisition: Get users in door, hope they upgrade.<br/>
        Monetization: Limit features to force paid upgrades.<br/>
        Data: Learn from free users, improve product (you're R&D tester).<br/>
        Someone pays: Either you (eventually) or advertisers (with your attention).

              <li>• <strong>Hook:</strong> Offer free tier with basic features</li>
              <li>• <strong>Investment:</strong> User spends 10-20 hours building site</li>
              <li>• <strong>Limits hit:</strong> Storage, bandwidth, features blocked</li>
              <li>• <strong>Pain point:</strong> Site goes down or can't grow</li>

              <li>• Pain avoidance: Pay $20/month vs migrate for 10 hours</li>
              <li>• Platform dependency: Site locked to platform (hostage)</li>

Potential customers can't view menu. Reservations lost. Professional reputation damaged. All to save $15/month. Lesson: Free tiers fail when you need them most.</p>

Needed forms. Forced upgrade. Had already invested 40 hours building site. Couldn't afford to migrate. Paid $25/month = $300/year. Would have been cheaper to start with Durable at $15/month.</p>

            <li>• <strong>Time value:</strong> Migration costs 5-20 hours = $250-1,000 (at $50/hour)</li>

          <ul class="space-y-2 text-lg">
            <li>• <strong>Testing:</strong> Use Durable 14-day free trial (no credit card, full features)</li>
            <li>• <strong>Validation:</strong> Test platform thoroughly, then commit or walk away</li>
            <li>• <strong>Budget launch:</strong> Durable $15/month flat = cheapest serious option</li>

          Brutal truth: "Free" websites cost more in lost revenue, time, and frustration than paid plans.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
          <strong>For serious use:</strong> Pay $15-20/month from day one. Durable gives you professional site, no limits, no watermarks, full features. $180/year is negligible for any serious business. The "free" option is false economy.<br/>
          <strong>For testing:</strong> Use Durable's 14-day free trial. Full feature access, no credit card, test thoroughly. Commit or walk away without surprise charges.<br/>
          <strong>For learning:</strong> Free tiers work if you're just learning. But understand: you're not building a real business site. You're playing with training wheels. When ready for business, pay for platform.<br/>
          <strong>Remember:</strong> Time is money. Migration takes 5-20 hours. That's $250-1,000 in value. Durable costs $180/year. Starting with paid plan saves $70-820. Free tiers are marketing, not charity. Platforms aren't charities. They're businesses. Free users are products, not customers. Be a customer, not a product. Pay $15-20/month. Save time, save stress, save revenue.
