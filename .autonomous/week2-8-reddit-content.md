## Week 2: r/webdev (Technical Focus)

### Post Title

```
After 6 weeks of testing AI website builders, here are the 5 that actually work
```

### Post Body

```
I spent 127 hours testing 23 AI website builders. Here's what I learned:

THE REALITY:
Most "AI" builders are just template remixers. Only 5 are worth using.

THE WINNERS (with scores):
1. Framer (9.3/10) - Stunning design, but locks you in
2. 10Web (8.8/10) - Best WordPress AI integration
3. Webflow (8.7/10) - Powerful, exportable code
4. Durable (8.5/10) - 30 seconds to live site
5. Squarespace (8.2/10) - Best for e-commerce

THE WORST:
Wix ADI (3.2/10) - Kept breaking, couldn't export, wasted 6 hours

THE TRUTH ABOUT AI BUILDERS:
- "AI-generated" usually means "template-based"
- Most lock you into their hosting
- Export limitations are common
- Design quality varies massively

I built a review site with full breakdowns:

Happy to answer questions about specific tools or the testing process.

What's your experience with AI website builders?
```

### Expected Results
- **Upvotes:** 30-80
- **Comments:** 15-40
- **Visitors:** 100-300

### Timing
- **Best:** Tuesday 9-11 AM EST
- **Good:** Wednesday or Thursday same time
- **Avoid:** Friday afternoon, weekends

## Week 3: r/entrepreneur (Business Focus)

### Post Title

```
I built a review site that should make $2,000/month (when I fix the one blocker)
```

### Post Body

```
After testing 23 AI website builders for 127 hours, I built a comprehensive review site.

THE BUSINESS MODEL:
- 468 pages of content (reviews, comparisons, guides)
- Affiliate commissions: 30-70% per referral
- Target: $2,000/month at maturity
- Path: ~25 referrals @ $80 avg commission

THE SITE:
- 27 detailed reviews (scores: 3.2 to 9.3/10)
- 150+ comparison articles
- 114 guides
- 87+ "best for [industry]" pages

THE BLOCKER:
Currently at $0/month because:
❌ 22 placeholder affiliate codes (need to join programs)
❌ Waiting on affiliate approvals
❌ Haven't started traffic yet

THE PLAN:
Week 1-4: Join affiliate programs + initial traffic
Week 5-12: Scale traffic (Reddit, Twitter, communities)
Month 6+: Target $2,000/month

Site is live: https://vcelyy.github.io/ai-website-builders/

Questions about the business model, testing process, or tools?

## Week 5: r/freelance (Client Work Focus)

### Post Title

```
Freelancers: Stop wasting hours on client websites (use these tools instead)
```

### Post Body

```
I see freelancers wasting time on websites when they should be focusing on clients.

After testing 23 AI website builders, here's what I recommend:

FOR CLIENT PORTFOLIOS:
→ Framer (9.3/10) - Stunning, quick, professional
→ Webflow (8.7/10) - If they need custom features

FOR CLIENT'S BUSINESS:
→ Squarespace (8.2/10) - E-commerce, restaurants
→ 10Web (8.8/10) - If they use WordPress

FOR QUICK PROTOTYPES:
→ Durable (8.5/10) - 30 seconds, show client, iterate

MY TESTING METHODOLOGY:
- 127 hours of hands-on testing
- 23 different tools
- 12 sites actually built
- 342 screenshots

Full breakdown: https://vcelyy.github.io/ai-website-builders/

TL;DR: Don't code from scratch. Use AI builders. Spend your time on client work, not websites.

What tools do you use for client sites?
```

### Expected Results
- **Upvotes:** 40-120
- **Comments:** 20-50
- **Visitors:** 100-300

### Timing
- **Best:** Thursday 9-11 AM EST
- **Good:** Tuesday or Wednesday same time

## Week 6: r/webdev (Follow-up/AMA)

### Post Title

```
[Update] 2 weeks ago I posted about testing 23 AI website builders. Here's what happened.
```

### Post Body

```
2 weeks ago, I posted about spending 127 hours testing 23 AI website builders.

UPDATE: TRAFFIC RESULTS
- Reddit post: 200+ visitors
- Twitter thread: 80+ visitors

- Total: ~430 visitors

UPDATE: AFFILIATE SIGNUPS

- Waiting on approvals
- Still 19 to go
- Revenue: $0 (but progress!)

UPDATE: SITE IMPROVEMENTS

But: Site is excellent, traffic is starting, affiliate programs joining slowly.

Path to $2,000/month: On track, just need time.

## Comment Response Templates

### For "Framer is overrated"

```
Valid point. The lock-in is real (can't export code).

But for pure design quality and speed, nothing beats it.

Tradeoff: Stunning design vs. ownership
→ Need full control? Webflow or 10Web
→ Want fast & beautiful? Framer

My rating: 9.3/10 (with lock-in caveat)
```

### For "What about [tool I didn't test]?"

```
Good question!

If I tested it: Full review at [link]
If not: "Not in my test yet. What's your experience with it?"
```

### For "This seems like an ad"

```
Fair concern. Full disclosure:

This is an affiliate site - I earn commissions if you sign up.

BUT: Every score is based on actual hands-on testing (127 hours, 23 tools, 342 screenshots).

No paid placements, no fake reviews. Just real testing data.

Transparency matters to me.
```

### For "How do you make money?"

```
```

### For "Great project! What's your tech stack?"

```
Astro (static site generator)
Tailwind CSS
GitHub Pages (free hosting)
Build time: 93 seconds
468 pages, 54MB
```
