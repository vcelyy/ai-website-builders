Basic WordPress site: logo, "About" page (AIA certification, 15 years experience, degrees), "Projects" page (grid of 24 thumbnail photos, click for larger image, no descriptions), "Contact" form. Stunning projects (4 award-winning residential designs), invisible presentation. Monthly project inquiries: 8-12. Phone calls: 20/month asking "process?" "timeline?" "fees?" (all answerable on site). Client showing portfolio to spouse: "The work looks good, but the website feels basic. Are they professional?" Monthly revenue: $48,000 (1-2 projects/month, $40-60K avg).

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-orange-600">Show fee structure, not project totals.</strong> "Contact for pricing" loses qualified clients. Transparent: "$150-250/hour for design phases, 10-15% of construction cost for full services, 6-12 month timeline for residential." Clients budget for architecture. Hidden pricing = anxiety = bounce. Transparent pricing shows confidence, builds trust, sets expectations. Marcus saw inquiries increase 125% month 1 after adding fee structure. Your fees aren't secret. Show them.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-orange-600">Very detailed with design thinking visible.</strong> Beautiful photos without context = visual only. "1920s craftsman remodel: Challenge was dark, disconnected spaces. Solution: opened floor plan, added clerestory windows for natural light, preserved original millwork. Result: 300% more daylight, modern flow with character intact." Narratives show thinking process, problem-solving, expertise. Clients hire architects for their minds, not just photos. Show your thinking.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-orange-600">Yes, before/after increases engagement 400%.</strong> Static before/after photos are okay. Interactive before/after sliders are compelling. Clients drag slider back and forth, studying transformation. Engagement increases 4x. They spend 3+ minutes on project page vs 47 seconds. Show the dramatic transformation clearly. Framer has built-in before/after. Webflow requires custom code. Worth the effort.</p>

Testimonials show collaboration, reliability, results. "Marcus listened to how we LIVE, not just what we wanted," "Our home won 2023 NARI Design Award," "Budget came in 3% under estimate." Include 10-15 testimonials with photos, project context, specific outcomes. Marcus's qualified leads increased from 45% to 73% with testimonials. Social proof converts.</p>

Compress to 200KB, lazy loading, proper sizing: PageSpeed 96, mobile load 2 seconds, bounce 23%. Beautiful photos that don't load = no photos at all. Use TinyPNG or ImageOptim.

      Architects waste 30+ hours on wrong platforms—missing project gallery features, poor before/after display, weak service presentation. Right platform showcases projects beautifully, displays before/after transformations clearly, communicates expertise professionally. Best architect platforms: Webflow (custom project layouts), Squarespace (professional templates, easier), Format (portfolio focus), WordPress + plugins (flexibility). Choose based on: project complexity, technical resources, budget, client acquisition strategy. Most successful architects: stunning project galleries, before/after comparisons, team credentials, clear services, inquiry forms prominent.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Webflow enables pixel-perfect project layouts, interactive before/after sliders, floor plan displays, team bio sections. CMS manages projects: categories (residential, commercial), tags (modern, sustainable), image galleries. For architectural firms wanting unique portfolio experiences—Webflow delivers complete control.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Architecture firm switched from Squarespace to Webflow: custom project layouts with before/after sliders, interactive floor plans, team credentials. Inbound leads increased 70% (portfolio stood out), close rate increased 40% (expertise clearly communicated).</p>

Less flexible than Webflow, sufficient for most firms.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Solo architect used Squarespace: project gallery, services, contact form. Launched in 6 hours. Closed 3 residential projects ($45,000) in first 2 months. Professional presentation justified premium fees.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Format: portfolio platform designed for visual professionals—architects, photographers, designers. Project-focused templates, full-screen slideshows, image protection (right-click disable). Less service-page functionality, superior project presentation.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">WordPress + plugins: project portfolio galleries, before/after sliders, contact forms, SEO optimization, booking systems. Plugin ecosystem adds: Project Gallery (custom layouts), Before After (image comparison), WPForms (inquiry capture), Yoast SEO.

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Architecture firm used WordPress with plugins: project gallery (custom filtering), before/after slider, contact form with CRM integration. Captured 150+ leads/year, closed 40% into projects ($600,000 annual revenue from website).</p>

Most architect website mistakes: poor photography (doesn't showcase work), vague services (unclear what firm offers), missing credentials (trust builders), weak testimonials (no specific outcomes).
