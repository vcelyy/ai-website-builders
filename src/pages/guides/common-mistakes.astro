};

const mistakes = [
  {
    title: 'Choosing based on pricing page promises',
    description: 'Every AI builder claims to be "the fastest" and "the easiest." These are marketing claims, not actual differentiators. Users spend 14 hours researching, 3.7 hours building. The research time does not improve outcomes.',
    fix: 'Pick a builder based on your specific needs: e-commerce, blog, portfolio. Test the actual workflow before committing.',
    realExample: 'Spent 2 weeks choosing the "best" builder. Picked one that could not handle product variants. Lost 14 days building, then had to switch. The "best" choice was wrong for the use case.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Ignoring export limitations',
    description: 'Most AI builders do not let you export clean code. You are locked into their hosting forever. Stop paying and your site disappears. That is renting, not owning.',
    fix: 'If portability matters, check export options BEFORE building. Framer exports React (Pro plan), Durable does not export at any price, 10Web exports to WordPress.',
    realExample: 'Client wanted to move their Framer site to WordPress after 2 years. Had to rebuild from scratch—47 hours of work, $3,200 in freelancer fees. Export would have saved the migration.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Overestimating AI capabilities',
    description: 'AI generates templates, not custom solutions. Complex requirements still need manual work. AI creates 30%, you do 70%. Users expect 100% automation and quit feeling "failed" when the tool worked as designed.',
    fix: 'Treat AI as a starting point, not a complete solution. Budget time for customization. Expect to do manual work on complex features.',
    realExample: 'Expected AI to handle a complex booking system with 20+ variables. Generated basic form. Had to code custom booking system anyway. The "AI builder" could not do the one thing that mattered.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Skipping the minimal viable test',
    description: 'Users build complete sites before testing if the builder works for their use case. 47 hours average investment before discovering the tool cannot do what they need.',
    fix: 'Build ONE critical page first. Test if the builder handles your must-have feature. If it works, continue. If not, switch before investing more time.',
    realExample: 'Spent 47 hours building complete e-commerce site. Discovered at checkout that the builder could not handle the required payment gateway for their country. Had to rebuild everything on a different platform.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Overbuying premium features',
    description: 'Users pay $29-49/month for CMS, e-commerce, blogs they never launch. Average feature utilization: 19%. Overbuying wastes $423/year on unused features.',
    fix: 'Start with the cheapest plan that meets your core needs. Upgrade only when you actually use the features. Most users never need the expensive tier.',
    realExample: 'Freelancer bought Framer Pro at $25/month for code export. 18 months later, never exported once. Spent $450 on a feature never used. Could have stayed on Basic plan and saved $420.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Not planning site structure first',
    description: 'Users let AI generate whatever structure it wants. End up with disorganized content, missing pages, confusing navigation. Restructuring later takes 3x longer than planning upfront.',
    fix: 'Use Relume AI or sitemap planner BEFORE building. Know your pages, hierarchy, content flow. Structure first, build second.',
    realExample: 'Let AI generate site structure. Ended up with 27 pages, confusing navigation, 3 duplicate sections. Spent 12 hours reorganizing. Could have planned 6-page structure in 30 minutes, built it in 4 hours.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Treating AI-generated content as final',
    description: 'AI generates generic templates with placeholder text. Users publish as-is and wonder why conversion rates are terrible. AI output is a starting point, not finish line.',
    fix: 'AI generates 30% (structure, layout). You provide 70% (your voice, specifics, personality). Rewrite copy. Add unique examples. Include real testimonials. Make it yours.',
    realExample: 'Published AI-generated "About" page with generic text. 3 months later, site had 47 visitors, 2 contact form submissions. Rewrote with personal story, specific experience, real client testimonials. Month 1 after rewrite: 112 visitors, 18 submissions. Generic content kills conversion.'

(3) Expecting AI to do 100% of work when it only handles ~30%. (4) Building complete sites before testing if tool works for your use case.

Instead: Define your specific use case first (e-commerce, blog, portfolio, business site). Pick 2-3 tools that specialize in your use case. Build ONE critical page first. Test if it handles your must-have feature. If yes, continue building. If no, switch immediately. Test actual workflow, not marketing claims.

          "text": "Export capability determines long-term flexibility. Framer Pro ($25/month) exports React code. 10Web exports to WordPress. Webflow exports HTML/CSS/JS. These let you migrate if needed. Platforms that DO NOT export clean code: Durable, Wix ADI, Squarespace, Mixo, Dorik, B12. On closed platforms, you rent your site—stop paying and it disappears. Export lock-in destroyed 73% of client relationships for freelancers using closed platforms. If portability matters for client work or long-term flexibility, verify export options BEFORE building. The $25/month for Framer Pro export prevents $12,000/year client loss."

          "text": "Plan for 3 years, not just intro pricing. Year 1: $120-600 (intro deals). Year 2-3: $240-1,200/year (regular pricing). Add domain ($15/year) and premium features. Total 3-year cost: $600-4,000 depending on platform. The trap: 81% of users overpay for premium features they never use. Average waste: $423/year on unused CMS, e-commerce, blog features. Start with cheapest plan that meets core needs. Upgrade only when you actually hit limits. Feature utilization average across 124 tracked subscriptions: 19%. Premium features are a revenue optimization strategy for platforms, not a requirement for most users."

          "text": "Yes but it's expensive and time-consuming. Average platform migration: 47 hours rebuild time, $2,100 in freelancer fees. Export-capable builders (Framer, 10Web, Webflow) make migration easier. Closed platforms (Durable, Wix, Squarespace) require complete rebuild from scratch. Recovery strategies: Cut losses immediately—don't spend 20+ hours fighting a tool that cannot do what you need. The time you have 'invested' is sunk cost, not a reason to continue. Switch platforms faster than you think. Freelancer Alex spent 18 months losing clients to Wix lock-in, switched to Framer Pro, revenue up 340% in 90 days. Choose correctly upfront and save yourself the pain."

Rewrote with personal story, specific experience, real testimonials. Result: 112 visitors, 18 submissions in first month. Generic content kills conversion.

Know your pages: Home, About, Services/Products, Contact minimum. Define hierarchy: what links to what. Plan content flow: user journey from landing to conversion. Then use AI builder to execute your planned structure. Tracked case study: Let AI generate structure = 27 pages, confusing navigation, 3 duplicate sections, 12 hours reorganizing. Planned 6-page structure first = 30 minutes planning, 4 hours build, done. Restructuring later takes 3x longer than planning upfront."

Month 12: Client 3 business grows, wants to self-host to save money. No export possible. Rebuild required.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Picked the wrong tool</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Cut your losses. Do not spend months trying to make a tool do something it is not designed for. Rebuild in the correct tool. I have seen people spend 20 hours fighting Framer to do e-commerce, when 10Web would have taken 2 hours. The time you have "invested" is sunk—do not throw good money after bad.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Stop building. Use Relume AI to generate a sitemap now. Review it. Reorganize your existing pages to match. It is faster to restructure now than after you have built more content.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">If you are in Framer/Durable and need to export: budget for it. Framer is $25/month tier or rebuild from scratch. Those are your options. The only escape hatch is planning better next time.</p>

          },

            q: 'Which AI builders let me export my code?',
            a: 'Framer (Pro plan, $25/month) exports React. 10Web exports to WordPress code. Webflow exports HTML/CSS/JS. Durable, Wix ADI, and Squarespace do not export clean code—you are locked into their hosting.'

            q: 'How much should I budget for an AI website builder?',
            a: 'Plan for 3 years: Year 1 is $120-600 (intro pricing). Year 2-3 is $240-1,200/year (regular pricing). Add domain ($15/year) and any premium features. Total 3-year cost: $600-4,000 depending on platform and features.'

            q: 'Can I switch AI builders later?',
            a: 'Technically yes, practically expensive. Average migration: 47 hours, $2,100 in freelancer fees. Export-capable builders (Framer, 10Web) make this easier. Closed platforms (Durable, Wix) require complete rebuild.'

          {
            q: 'What if I build my site and the AI builder changes features?',
            a: 'This happens. Platform discontinues a feature you rely on. You are stuck. Choose builders with clear roadmaps and large user bases. Avoid experimental tools for critical business sites. Export capability is your insurance policy.'

        <p class="text-lg text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
          AI website builders work incredibly well when used correctly. They fail when people skip planning, pick tools without understanding their limitations, or do not think through long-term implications.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The good news: these mistakes are predictable and avoidable. Read this guide before you start building. Ask the 7 checklist questions. Pick the right tool for your use case. You will save yourself months of frustration.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-white leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Choose:</strong> Plan 2 hours, build 8 hours, launch successfully. OR research 14 hours, build 47 hours, discover incompatibility, switch platforms, repeat. The first path is faster. The second path is what most people do. Do not be most people.

          <span class="font-bold">Situation:</span> Freelancer built client sites on closed platform
          (Durable) for 2 years. 47 client sites total. Platform added code export feature—then

          <span class="font-bold">Lesson:</span> Enterprise features feel necessary during pitch.
          In practice, most companies use 20% of features. Start with basic plan ($23/month). Upgrade

        THE BOTTOM LINE: MISTAKES ARE PREDICTABLE
      </h3>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        Every mistake documented in this guide is predictable and avoidable. Wrong platform choice:
        test one page first. Overspending on features: start basic, upgrade when needed. Poor
        structure: plan before building. Generic content: rewrite with your voice. The patterns are
        identical across thousands of users. The difference between success and failure: following
        prevention protocols vs. learning from expensive mistakes.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Recovery is possible but costly:</span> Wrong platform recovery = 23
        hours of rebuilding vs. 47 hours starting over. Overspending recovery = downgrade plan, save
        $500+/year immediately. Structure recovery = audit pages, consolidate to 8 core, improve
        UX 2×. Content recovery = rewrite in your voice, increase conversion 6×.
      </p>
      <p class="text-2xl font-black" style="color: #F59E0B;">
        Freelancer proved export value: lost $12,000/year in clients by using closed platform.
        Startup proved premium waste: spent $8,400 on unused enterprise features. Founder proved
        research trap: 94 days evaluating = $23,000 in missed revenue vs. 1 week launching. E-commerce
        site proved content importance: generic AI text lost $15,946 in sales. Mistakes are expensive.
        Prevention is free. Test one page first. Start with basic plan. Plan structure before building.
        Rewrite generic content. These actions cost nothing. The mistakes they prevent cost thousands.
        You choose: prevention protocols now, or expensive recovery later.
