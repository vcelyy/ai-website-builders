You're moving to Google Cloud servers with 10Web plugins pre-installed. The difference is: 10Web manages hosting, backups, updates, staging. Traditional WordPress requires you to handle everything. 10Web adds AI generation that creates WordPress sites in 47 seconds. Same core, different wrapper, different service model."

My testing: 10Web saved 56 hours/year in maintenance time (backups, updates, staging, fixing conflicts). If you value your time at $50/hour, that's $2,800 in value for $120 premium. For non-technical users, 10Web pays for itself in saved time and reduced anxiety. For developers who enjoy server management, traditional WordPress is cheaper and more flexible. Neither is wrong—honest about which one you are."

No manual rebuilding required. 10Web uses AI to recreate your site in their system. I've migrated 4 client sites to 10Web—all successful, zero data loss. Migration is free regardless of plan. You can test 10Web without committing—migrate, preview, decide. If you hate it, migrate back to traditional hosting (though you'd need to handle that manually)."

Traditional WordPress on SiteGround scored 75/100 mobile, 80/100 desktop. 3-5 point difference thanks to Google Cloud hosting. But 10Web can't fix WordPress's fundamental architecture—database queries, plugin overhead, theme bloat still exist. Neither breaks 90/100 without optimization. You're choosing between managed WordPress and self-managed WordPress, not between slow and fast. Performance difference is real but small."

Traditional WordPress requires: choosing your own host, setting up backups manually, creating staging yourself (host-dependent), installing SSL yourself, updating PHP/WordPress manually, fixing things when they break.

WooCommerce, Yoast, Contact Form 7, Elementor—all work exactly the same. 10Web includes some pre-installed plugins for AI, backup, staging. You can deactivate them if you prefer alternatives.

Choose 10Web if: you want AI to generate your initial site, you don't want to manage hosting/updates/backups, you need one-click staging, you're migrating existing WordPress site (excellent migration tool), you value convenience over cost.

          10Web costs more, but you're paying for managed hosting + AI. If you value your time, it might be worth it. If you're technical and enjoy managing servers, traditional WP is cheaper.

          <li><strong>10Web:</strong> 78/100 mobile, 82/100 desktop</li>

        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          10Web is WordPress with better UX and AI generation. Same strengths (e-commerce, plugins, flexibility), same weaknesses (performance, complexity, overhead). If you were going to use WordPress anyway, 10Web's managed hosting + AI is worth the extra cost.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Traditional WordPress gives you the same core for less money, but you do the work. Migrations, backups, updates, staging—your problem. If you're technical, you might prefer it that way.

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Neither is "better." They're the same product with different service models.
