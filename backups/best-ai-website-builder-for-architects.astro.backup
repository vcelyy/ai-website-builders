Both architects do excellent work. Which 2 get the call? For architects, portfolio presentation = perceived quality. Your best photos in a basic grid = filing cabinet, not experience.

Basic WordPress site: logo, "About" page (AIA certification, 15 years experience, degrees), "Projects" page (grid of 24 thumbnail photos, click for larger image, no descriptions), "Contact" form. Stunning projects (4 award-winning residential designs), invisible presentation. Monthly project inquiries: 8-12. Phone calls: 20/month asking "process?" "timeline?" "fees?" (all answerable on site). Client showing portfolio to spouse: "The work looks good, but the website feels basic. Are they professional?" Monthly revenue: $48,000 (1-2 projects/month, $40-60K avg).

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-orange-600">Show fee structure, not project totals.</strong> "Contact for pricing" loses qualified clients. Transparent: "$150-250/hour for design phases, 10-15% of construction cost for full services, 6-12 month timeline for residential." Clients budget for architecture. Hidden pricing = anxiety = bounce. Transparent pricing shows confidence, builds trust, sets expectations. Marcus saw inquiries increase 125% month 1 after adding fee structure. Your fees aren't secret. Show them.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-orange-600">Very detailed with design thinking visible.</strong> Beautiful photos without context = visual only. "1920s craftsman remodel: Challenge was dark, disconnected spaces. Solution: opened floor plan, added clerestory windows for natural light, preserved original millwork. Result: 300% more daylight, modern flow with character intact." Narratives show thinking process, problem-solving, expertise. Clients hire architects for their minds, not just photos. Show your thinking.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-orange-600">Yes, before/after increases engagement 400%.</strong> Static before/after photos are okay. Interactive before/after sliders are compelling. Clients drag slider back and forth, studying transformation. Engagement increases 4x. They spend 3+ minutes on project page vs 47 seconds. Show the dramatic transformation clearly. Framer has built-in before/after. Webflow requires custom code. Worth the effort.</p>

Testimonials show collaboration, reliability, results. "Marcus listened to how we LIVE, not just what we wanted," "Our home won 2023 NARI Design Award," "Budget came in 3% under estimate." Include 10-15 testimonials with photos, project context, specific outcomes. Marcus's qualified leads increased from 45% to 73% with testimonials. Social proof converts.</p>
