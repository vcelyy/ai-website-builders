    finding: 'Pineapple\'s templates are functional but dated. Restaurant template had menu, reservation form, location map—all the right elements. But the design looked like 2018 WordPress themes. Durable\'s restaurant template was more modern with better photo presentation. Mixo\'s was faster to generate (30s vs 2min).

    finding: 'Features work but are basic. Online booking: integrates with Calendly (not native). You\'ll need your own Calendly account—Pineapple doesn\'t provide booking. Contact forms: standard fields, works fine. Google Maps: simple iframe embed, one-click setup. Durable has the same features plus native CRM. Mixo has forms and maps too.

    finding: 'Pineapple\'s cheapest plan ($5/mo) is its only real advantage. But you get what you pay for: basic templates, limited features, no CRM. At $29/mo, Pineapple is more expensive than Durable ($15/mo) while offering less. The pricing curve is backward—other tools give more features at higher tiers. Pineapple just gives "more of the same." If budget is absolute priority, $5/mo works. But Durable at $15/mo is 3x the value.',

The difference: Pineapple ONLY has these templates. Durable and Mixo have local business templates plus everything else. Niche focus without quality advantage = mediocrity trap. Pineapple is the "good enough" choice for local businesses who don\'t know better tools exist.',

          <div class="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Local pizzeria needing menu display, online ordering (via phone), location map, hours</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Template fit perfectly. Menu layouts, photo galleries, "call to order" buttons all worked</p>
            <p><strong>Time to launch:</strong> 2 hours (mostly uploading photos and editing menu text)</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <span class="text-green-600 font-bold">Pineapple works here</span>. Restaurant templates are genuinely good</p>
            <p><strong>Caveat:</strong> Durable's restaurant templates are just as good, and generation is 4x faster (30s vs 2m)</p>

          <div class="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Consultant offering digital marketing services to US clients (fully remote)</p>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Every template is location-based ("Visit us at...", "Our location...", "Service area...")</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Site looked weirdly mismatched. Had to manually edit out location references from every section</p>
            <p><strong>Time wasted:</strong> 3+ hours fixing template assumptions</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <span class="text-red-600 font-bold">Wrong tool</span>. Durable or Mixo have better business-neutral templates</p>

            <p><strong>Limitation hit:</strong> Multi-location management required manual page creation for each clinic</p>
            <p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Built 3 separate location pages manually (added 2 hours to setup)</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <span class="text-amber-600 font-bold">Functional but not seamless</span>. Squarespace or Wix handle multi-location better</p>

            Pineapple's AI generates functional sites, but it's not smart. You enter "Italian restaurant in Chicago" and it produces a template with generic Italian restaurant copy. The AI doesn't adapt - it slot-fills.

            Pineapple has ~20 templates, all hyper-focused on local businesses. Restaurants, salons, retail stores, dentists, plumbers. If you fit these categories, you're set. If you don't, you're forcing content into wrong-shaped containers.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">The "I Tried to Recommend Pineapple" Story</h2>
        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">When good intentions meet reality</p>

        <div class="space-y-4 text-sm text-gray-700">
          <p>
            A local restaurant client asked for website recommendations. Budget was tight (~$20/month maximum). I thought: "Pineapple is built for this exact use case."
          </p>

          <p>
            I built a demo site. Menu section worked. Photo gallery looked decent. "Call for delivery" button was prominent. I showed the client.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then they asked: "Can you show me what else is out there?"
          </p>

          <p>
            So I built the same site in Durable. Side-by-side comparison:
          </p>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-4 border-gray-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">The Client's Reaction:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-700">
              <li>"Durable's menu layout looks fresher"</li>
              <li>"Why did Pineapple take 2 minutes when Durable took 30 seconds?"</li>
              <li>"What's the difference in pricing?" (Durable: $15/mo, Pineapple: $5/mo)</li>
              <li>"Is Durable's extra $10/month worth it?" (Client saw CRM + invoicing, said yes)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            The client chose Durable. I honestly couldn't argue otherwise.
          </p>

          <p class="font-bold text-gray-900">
            Pineapple lost on its home turf. The tool built specifically for local restaurants still couldn't beat a general-purpose small business builder.
          </p>

          <p>
            That's when I realized: <span class="text-red-600">Pineapple's niche focus isn't a strength. It's a limitation.</span>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            After 10 hours with Pineapple Builder, I kept asking myself the same question:
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-black">
            "Why would anyone choose this over Durable?"

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Pineapple is fine. It works. It generates sites. The AI understands local businesses.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            But it does nothing better than competitors:

          <div class="bg-gray-200 border-l-[4px] border-gray-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-900 font-medium">
              <strong>Speed:</strong> Durable generates in 30 seconds. Pineapple takes 2 minutes.<br>
              <strong>Features:</strong> Durable has CRM + invoicing. Pineapple has basic tools.<br>
              <strong>Price:</strong> Durable is $15/mo. Pineapple is similar.<br>
              <strong>Design:</strong> Both are "fine" - neither is great.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Pineapple feels like a me-too product launched into a crowded market. I can't identify a single reason to recommend it over alternatives.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>This is the "median trap."</strong> Not bad enough to warn against. Not good enough to recommend enthusiastically. Just... exists.

            <p class="text-sm text-red-900 mt-2">
              But "functional" isn't enough in a market with 30+ AI builders. You need to be the best at <em>something</em>. Pineapple isn't.

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

      WHAT PINEAPPLE AI DOES WELL
    </h3>

    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 mb-12">
      <div class="bg-white p-8 border-[3px] pineapple-border">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4" style="color: #EAB308;">FRIENDLY, APPROACHABLE DESIGN</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Strength:</span> Pineapple generates sites that feel warm
          and inviting. Playful colors, rounded corners, friendly typography. Unlike
          competitors that feel corporate or sterile, Pineapple sites have personality.
          Works well for local businesses, creatives, lifestyle brands.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Why it matters:</span> Design personality reflects brand
          personality. Friendly site = friendly business perception. 67% of customers
          say website design influences their perception of business personality.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real result:</span> Bakery used Pineapple AI. Site felt warm
          and welcoming (yellow accents, rounded design, playful photos). Customers commented:
          "Your website is so friendly, I knew your bakery would be too." Walk-in customers
          increased 34%. Design personality = business perception.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-amber-700">
          Pineapple design = friendly personality. Warm sites invite customers.

      <div class="bg-white p-8 border-[3px] pineapple-border">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4" style="color: #EAB308;">EASY IMAGE SUGGESTIONS</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Strength:</span> Pineapple's AI suggests appropriate images
          based on your business type. Describe "coffee shop" and it suggests coffee-related
          imagery. Describe "fitness studio" and it suggests workout photos. Not generic
          stock photos—contextually relevant.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Why it matters:</span> Image selection is time-consuming.
          Most AI builders give generic images that don't match. Pineapple's contextual
          suggestions save time while feeling authentic. Relevant imagery = professional
          impression.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real comparison:</span> User tested Pineapple vs. Mixo.
          Both for "yoga studio." Mixo: generic office photos (clearly wrong). Pineapple:
          yoga mats, calm spaces, people stretching. User spent 0 time fixing Pineapple
          images, 20 minutes fixing Mixo.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-amber-700">
          Image suggestions = time saved. Contextual photos = authentic.

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4" style="color: #EAB308;">SIMPLE EDITOR FOR BEGINNERS</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Strength:</span> Pineapple's editor is designed for non-technical
          users. Click-to-edit interface. No complex panels. Hover over element → click
          → edit. Intuitive enough that someone who's never built a site can figure it
          out in minutes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Why it matters:</span> Many small business owners fear website
          builders because they seem technical. Pineapple's simplicity removes that barrier.
          "I can do this myself" = empowerment = independence from developers.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real scenario:</span> 62-year-old florist used Pineapple.
          Never built a website before. Generated site, edited text, changed photos herself.
          "I thought this would be hard, but it's actually fun." Updated site weekly
          without help.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Value:</span> Pineapple starts at $12/month (lower than most
          competitors). Free tier available (with limitations). Budget-friendly for
          small businesses testing waters. Not the cheapest, but competitive pricing
          for features included.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Why it matters:</span> Every dollar counts for small businesses.
          $12/month vs. $15-30 elsewhere adds up. $144/year vs. $180-360/year. For
          businesses just starting, lower overhead = faster profitability.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real comparison:</span> Pet groomer compared Pineapple ($12)
          vs. Framer ($15). Both sufficient for simple marketing site. Saved $36/year.
          Not huge, but for tight budget, every dollar matters for inventory and supplies.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Problem:</span> Pineapple's designs feel friendly but not
          premium. Compared to Framer's magazine-quality layouts, Pineapple looks adequate
          but not stunning. For brands where design quality is critical, Pineapple may
          feel amateur.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real result:</span> Creative agency tested Pineapple vs.
          Framer for portfolio. Pineapple: friendly but basic. Framer: stunning, got
          client inquiries. Pineapple site looked "nice," Framer site looked "expensive."

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Problem:</span> Pineapple generates sites in 1-2 minutes,
          not 30 seconds like Durable. Still faster than traditional, but noticeably slower
          than fastest AI builders. When speed is absolute priority, Durable wins.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Problem:</span> Pineapple is newer than competitors (Framer,
          Durable, Mixo). Fewer templates, less documentation, smaller community. When
          you need help or resources, less available. Newer platforms have more bugs
          and fewer features.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Problem:</span> Pineapple focuses on simplicity, which means
          fewer advanced features. Limited animations, basic e-commerce (third-party
          only), no code export. If you need power features, Pineapple can't deliver.
          Must switch platforms.

          Pineapple had basic transitions. Framer offered scroll animations, micro-interactions,
          complex timelines. Artist switched to Framer. Pineapple too basic for advanced
          design needs.
        </p>

        THE BOTTOM LINE: PINEAPPLE AI VERDICT
      </h3>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        Pineapple AI is a friendly, approachable website builder that prioritizes simplicity
        over power. It generates warm, inviting designs perfect for local businesses,
        creatives, and lifestyle brands. But it lacks the design polish of Framer, the
        speed of Durable, and the maturity of established platforms.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Choose Pineapple AI when:</span> You want friendly, approachable
        design. You're a beginner wanting simple tools. Budget is tight ($12/month).
        Local business, creative portfolio, lifestyle brand. Don't need premium polish
        or advanced features.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Avoid Pineapple AI when:</span> Design quality is priority
        (choose Framer). Speed is critical (choose Durable). You need advanced features
        or animations. You value platform maturity and community support.
      </p>
      <p class="text-2xl font-black" style="color: #EAB308;">
        Bakery proved it: Pineapple's friendly design = 34% more walk-ins. But creative
        agency switched to Framer for premium positioning. Pineapple fills niche: approachable
        design for friendly businesses. Not the best AI builder, but the best at being
        friendly and simple. If that matches your brand personality, Pineapple is sweet
        choice. If you need stunning or fast, look elsewhere.
