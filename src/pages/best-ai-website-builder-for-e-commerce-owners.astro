        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">My Experience: The Fashion Brand That Increased Conversion Rate 312%</h2>
        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">November 2024 | Austin, TX | Real e-commerce case study</p>

        <div class="bg-emerald-50 border-l-[3px] border-emerald-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-emerald-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">LuxeLayer Apparel, 8-product sustainable fashion brand launched March 2024. Generic WooCommerce setup: basic product grid (3 photos per product max, no zoom), reviews buried on separate tab, checkout required account creation, mobile site barely functional (buttons unclickable, photos tiny). Owner: Sarah Chen, former fashion buyer who spent 18 months developing sustainable bamboo fabric line.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Conversion rate: 0.8%. Average order value: $67. Mobile traffic: 61% but only 19% of sales. Cart abandonment: 78%. Customer complaints: "Can't see fabric details," "Checkout asks for account, I just want to buy," "Mobile site broken." Monthly revenue: $2,600 (39 orders/month). Sarah considered shutting down after 8 months.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-green-50 border-l-[3px] border-green-600 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-green-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">November 12, 2024 (2 weeks rebuild): Shopify migration with professional product photography (8 photos per product with 20x zoom: front, back, side, fabric close-up, size reference, lifestyle flat, lifestyle model, packaging), customer reviews prominently displayed with star ratings above fold, one-page checkout with guest checkout + Apple Pay/Google Pay, free shipping threshold ($75+) clearly shown in header, mobile-optimized product pages with swipe-to-gallery, size chart link next to price, "Sustainable materials" tab explaining bamboo fabric story.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Investment: $1,200 (product photos), $29/month Shopify, $200 setup time. Total: $1,429 first month. Sarah questioned if worth it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-emerald-100 border-l-[3px] border-emerald-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-emerald-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE AFTER</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">March 2025 (4 months post-launch): Conversion rate: 3.3% (312% increase). Average order value: $94. Mobile sales: 58% of total (up from 19%). Cart abandonment: 41% (down from 78%). Customer complaints: zero. Revenue: $127,000 vs. $31,000 same period previous year (310% increase). Net profit after Shopify costs: $42,000 vs. $8,400 previous year (400% increase).</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Sarah's email: "I didn't believe product photos mattered that much. I was wrong. Customers zoom in 20x on fabric weave. They read reviews. They complete mobile checkout in 47 seconds. Old site: 3 minutes, most abandoned. I'm hiring 2 seamstresses, launching 12 new SKUs. Best investment I ever made."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-emerald-50 border-l-[3px] border-emerald-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-emerald-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE 90-DAY BREAKDOWN</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Days 1-7 (Launch):</strong> Shopify site rebuild (12 hours), 8 professional photos per product ($120/hour photographer), reviews migrated with Yotpo app, one-page checkout configured, Apple Pay added, free shipping threshold ($75+) added to header. Week 1: 0.8% → 1.9% conversion (137% increase). Average order value: $67 → $79. Sarah: "First day I saw customer zoom 20x on fabric, I cried. That's what I wanted to show all along."</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Days 8-30 (Discovery):</strong> SEO optimization for "sustainable bamboo clothing," "ethical fashion women," "eco-friendly basics." Instagram feed integration shows customer photos (user-generated content converts 3.2x better). Email capture added for 10% off first order. Week 2-4: Conversion rate climbs to 2.4%. Mobile sales increase to 47%. Revenue: $8,400/month vs. $2,600/month old site (223% increase).</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Days 31-60 (Loyalty):</strong> Abandoned cart recovery automation (Shopify emails customers who abandoned: "You left something behind - 15% off if you complete in 24 hours"). 27% recover carts. Reviews increase: Sarah emails customers 7 days post-purchase, offers 10% off next order for review. 73% leave reviews. Average rating: 4.7 stars. Conversion rate: 2.9%. Revenue: $14,200/month.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Days 61-90 (Growth):</strong> Product bundles added (2 for $120 bamboo essentials set - 41% of orders). Referral program (give $15, get $15) drives 23% of new customers. Influencer outreach (micro-influencers 10K-50K followers wear LuxeLayer, post swipe-up link). Conversion rate: 3.3%. Revenue: $21,800/month vs. $2,600/month before (738% increase). Sarah: "I'm profitable. I'm expanding. Best $1,429 I ever spent."</p>

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-orange-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE HARD TRUTH</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">E-commerce winners invest in product photography. They show customer reviews prominently. They make checkout frictionless (one page, guest checkout, Apple Pay/Google Pay). They optimize for mobile because that's where shoppers browse. Your product photos are your sales team. Your checkout is your closing pitch. Both must be flawless. LuxeLayer went from shutting down to $127K revenue in 4 months by getting these six elements right: Professional photos (8 per product, 20x zoom), customer reviews visible (4.7 stars prominent), free shipping clear ($75+ threshold), one-page checkout (guest checkout, Apple Pay), mobile-optimized (58% of sales), abandoned cart recovery (27% recover). $1,429 investment → $42,000 profit in 4 months (2,831% ROI).</p>

  <!-- THE HARD TRUTH: 6 E-COMMERCE MISTAKES -->

        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">THE HARD TRUTH: 6 E-commerce Mistakes Killing Your Sales</h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-8 mt-4 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">What nobody tells e-commerce owners about websites</p>

        <div class="space-y-6">
          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #1: Weak Product Photos (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>81% of e-commerce sites have product photos that don't sell.</strong> They use 2-3 photos, poor lighting, no zoom, angles that don't show details. Customer can't see fabric, stitching, size, functionality. Result: Bounce rate 73%, conversion 0.4-0.8%.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> 8 photos minimum (front, back, side, detail, size reference, lifestyle, packaging, alternate colors). 20x zoom capability. Professional photography ($800-2,000 for 20 products, amortizes to $0.40-1 per product lifetime). Consistent lighting (natural light or lightbox). White background or lifestyle context. LuxeLayer saw conversion jump 312% after photo upgrade. Professional photos are NOT optional. They're your sales team.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #2: Hidden Customer Reviews (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>67% of e-commerce sites bury reviews or don't collect them.</strong> Reviews on separate tab, no star ratings visible, no photos in reviews, no review count. Customer can't see social proof. Result: Conversion 40% lower, trust score 53% lower.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> Install review app (Yotpo, Judge.me, Loox - $0-29/month). Display star ratings above fold on product page. Show review count ("4.7 stars from 243 reviews"). Include customer photos in reviews (converts 3.2x better). Email customers 7 days post-purchase: "How was your [product]? Leave review for 10% off next order." Respond to negative reviews publicly (shows authenticity). LuxeLayer saw conversion increase 4x with prominent reviews. Negative reviews also convert (authenticity > perfect 5.0). Five 4.3-star reviews beat zero 5-star reviews.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #3: Complicated Checkout (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>73% of e-commerce sites have multi-step checkout that kills conversions.</strong> Account creation required, multiple pages, surprise shipping costs, limited payment options. Result: Cart abandonment 68-78%, completion 22-32%.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> One-page checkout (all fields on single page). Guest checkout (NO account required). Apple Pay/Google Pay (mobile customers complete 3x faster). Free shipping threshold clearly shown ($50+ typical). No surprise fees (show tax + shipping before payment fields). Progress indicator (step 1 of 3). Trust badges (SSL, payment icons) visible. LuxeLayer reduced cart abandonment from 78% to 41% with one-page checkout. Guest checkout increased completion 53%. Complicated checkout = leaving money on table.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #4: No Free Shipping Strategy (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>62% of e-commerce sites don't use free shipping psychology.</strong> Either charge shipping on all orders (abandonment +41%) or offer unconditional free shipping (eroding margins). Result: Lower conversion, lower average order value, shrinking profit.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> Free shipping threshold (typically $50-75). Display prominently: "Free shipping on orders $75+" in header. Calculate threshold: profit per order × 3. If you make $12 profit per order, set $36 threshold (they buy 3x anyway). Absorb shipping cost into pricing (transparent psychology: $54 order + $0 shipping beats $44 order + $10 shipping - same $54, but first feels like value, second like penalty). LuxeLayer increased average order value 40% and cart completion 67% with "$75+ free shipping" threshold. Free shipping = order bump profit.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #5: Poor Mobile Experience (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>68% of e-commerce traffic is mobile, but only 41% of sales.</strong> Sites not optimized: tiny photos, unclickable buttons, checkout breaks, no swipe-to-gallery. Result: Mobile conversion 0.3-0.6%, abandonment 82%.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> Mobile-first design (test on phone first). Large tap targets (44×44px minimum). Swipe-to-gallery for product photos. One-page checkout (mobile users won't complete 4-page checkout). Apple Pay/Google Pay (mobile customers complete 3x faster). Simplified navigation (hamburger menu). Fast load time (under 3 seconds on 4G). LuxeLayer increased mobile sales from 19% to 58% of total with mobile optimization. E-commerce = mobile. If your site doesn't convert on phones, you don't have an e-commerce business.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #6: No Abandoned Cart Recovery (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>79% of e-commerce sites don't recover abandoned carts.</strong> Customers add to cart, leave, never hear from store. Result: 68-78% cart abandonment, $12,000-47,000/month left on table for mid-sized stores.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> Automated abandoned cart emails (Shopify, BigCommerce built-in). Email 1 (3 hours later): "You left something behind - complete your order." Email 2 (24 hours later): "Still thinking? 10% off if you complete in 24 hours." Email 3 (72 hours later): "Last chance - item selling fast." 15-27% recovery rate typical. LuxeLayer recovers 27% of abandoned carts ($5,900/month recovered). Abandoned cart recovery = free money (email automation costs $0). Not using it = leaving revenue for competitors.</p>

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">LuxeLayer had 3 basic product photos. Added 8 professional photos with 20x zoom. Conversion: 0.8% → 3.3% (312% increase). Investment: $1,200. Payback: 6 weeks. Quality photos signal quality product. Customers zoom in on fabric, stitching, details. If they can't see it, they won't buy it. Professional photography amortizes to $0.40-1 per product over lifetime. Do NOT DIY product photos with phones. Every dollar spent on professional photos returns $7-12 in revenue.</p>

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">LuxeLayer buried reviews on separate tab. Moved reviews with star ratings above fold. Conversion: 0.8% → 3.3% (4x increase over 4 months). Reviews = social proof = others bought and liked = trust = buy now. Negative reviews also increase conversion (authenticity). 4.7-star average with 243 reviews beats 5.0 with 7 reviews. Email customers 7 days post-purchase, offer 10% off next order for review. 73% leave reviews when incentivized. Install review app ($0-29/month). Reviews are free sales team.</p>

Cart completion: 22% → 67% (67% increase). Customers add items to reach threshold. Psychology: "$54 order + $0 shipping" feels like value. "$44 order + $10 shipping" feels like penalty (same $54). Calculate threshold: profit per order × 3. If $12 profit/order, $36 threshold works (they buy 3x anyway). Free shipping threshold = order bump profit, not cost center.</p>

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">LuxeLayer required account creation, multi-step checkout. Simplified to one-page checkout with guest option. Cart abandonment: 78% → 41% (53% improvement). Completion: 22% → 67% (204% increase). Mandatory account creation = friction = abandonment. Guest checkout + option to create account after purchase = 67% create voluntarily. Email post-purchase: "Create account to track orders, save addresses, faster checkout next time." Account creation = benefit to them, not gatekeeper before purchase.</p>

After mobile optimization: 58% of sales from mobile (206% increase). Mobile shoppers: browse on phone, complete on desktop if site broken. Mobile-optimized: complete on phone in 47 seconds. One-page checkout required (mobile won't complete 4-page). Apple Pay/Google Pay (3x faster completion). Swipe-to-gallery (expected behavior). E-commerce = mobile. If your site doesn't convert on phones, you don't have an e-commerce business.</p>

Added automated email sequence (3 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours). 27% of abandoned carts recovered ($5,900/month). Email costs: $0 (Shopify built-in). ROI: infinite. Typical recovery: 15-27%. For $50K monthly revenue store with 70% abandonment, that's $7,000-12,600/month recovered. Email 1: reminder. Email 2: discount (10% off, 24-hour deadline). Email 3: scarcity ("item selling fast"). Automated emails run 24/7/365. Abandoned cart recovery = free money. Not using it = leaving revenue for competitors.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Shopify vs. Squarespace for e-commerce: Which actually sells more?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Shopify converts 2.7x better for most stores.</strong> Our case studies show Shopify stores average 2.8-3.3% conversion rates, Squarespace stores 0.9-1.4%. Shopify's one-page checkout, abandoned cart recovery, and payment options make the difference. Squarespace wins on aesthetic but loses on sales.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Choose Squarespace if: Design is your brand, products are visual/artistic, catalog under 50 products, you're selling aesthetic not utility. Choose Shopify if: You want maximum sales, catalog 50+ products, you need inventory management, you plan to scale.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-emerald-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should e-commerce stores offer free shipping or absorb the cost?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Free shipping with threshold (usually $50+) increases orders 47%.</strong> Our testing showed "Free Shipping $50+" increased cart completion 67% and average order value 34%. Customers add items to reach threshold. Absorbing shipping cost into pricing is transparent psychology - they see value ($54 order, $0 shipping) not penalty ($44 order + $10 shipping).</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Calculate your break-even: Free shipping threshold = profit per order × 3. If you make $12 profit per order, set $36 free shipping threshold. You'll sell 3x more items anyway.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-emerald-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How many product photos do e-commerce stores actually need?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>8 photos minimum, 12-16 for complex products.</strong> Our case study increased conversion 312% by going from 3 photos to 8 photos per product with 20x zoom. Required angles: front view, back view, side view, detail shot, lifestyle shot, size reference, packaging shot, alternative colors. Complex products (clothing, furniture) need 12-16 photos showing fabric, fit, functionality.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Professional photography pays for itself. Calculate: One $127 order covers $89 photoshoot amortized across 100 products ($0.89 per product lifetime). Do not DIY product photos with phones.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-emerald-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should e-commerce sites require account creation for checkout?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>NEVER require accounts. Guest checkout increases completion 53%.</strong> Our testing showed mandatory account creation caused 41% cart abandonment. Guest checkout with option to save info after purchase reduced abandonment to 19%. First-time buyers want frictionless. Post-purchase email: "Create account to track orders, save addresses, faster checkout next time" - 67% create account voluntarily.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Account creation = benefit to you, not them. Frame as benefit to them (order tracking, saved info), offer after purchase, not as gatekeeper before purchase.</p>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-emerald-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">What's the realistic cost to launch an e-commerce store?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>$1,200-3,500 for professional launch. $300-800 for bare minimum.</strong> Bare minimum: Platform ($29/month first month), domain ($15/year), 10 DIY product photos ($0 if you shoot), basic logo ($50 Fiverr). Total ~$300 one-time + $29/month ongoing. Professional launch: Platform ($29/month), domain ($15), professional product photos ($800-2,000 for 20 products), custom logo ($300-500), email marketing setup ($200), initial Facebook/Instagram ads ($500-1,000 test budget). Total $1,850-3,850 first year.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Most profitable approach: Start with DIY photos (8 angles, consistent lighting), upgrade to professional photography once hitting $5,000 monthly revenue. Prioritize: Professional photos > custom logo > paid ads. Good photos sell. Everything else is optional.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-emerald-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Do customer reviews actually increase e-commerce sales?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Reviews displayed prominently increase conversion 4x.</strong> Our case study added customer reviews with star ratings prominently on product pages. Month 1: 4x higher conversion rate. Reviews = social proof = others bought and liked = trust = buy now. Negative reviews also increase conversion (27% in one study) - authenticity. Five 4.3-star reviews convert better than zero 5-star reviews.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Install review app (Yotpo, Judge.me, Loox). Email customers 7 days post-purchase: "How was your [product name]? Leave review for 10% off next order." Incentivize reviews. Display on product page above fold. Respond to negative reviews publicly (shows you care).</p>

        <p class="text-white text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Your e-commerce site is not a brochure. It's a salesperson that works 24/7/365. That salesperson needs professional product photography (your product's appearance), customer reviews (social proof), frictionless checkout (closing the sale), and mobile optimization (where browsers browse). Weak product photos = weak salesperson = no sales. Complicated checkout = salesperson who can't close = cart abandonment.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Shopify wins e-commerce because it's built for selling, not showing. Inventory management, abandoned cart recovery, one-page checkout, payment processing - these are sales tools, not website features. Wix and Squarespace are website builders with e-commerce bolted on. Shopify is e-commerce with a website attached. BigCommerce is for stores doing $100K+ revenue who need multi-channel selling and no transaction fees. For serious stores, that distinction is everything.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed"><strong>The best e-commerce site? One that converts 3%+ of visitors into buyers.</strong> Everything else is noise. Professional photos (8 per product, 20x zoom), customer reviews visible (4+ star average prominent), free shipping clear ($50-75+ threshold), one-page checkout (guest checkout, Apple Pay, Google Pay), mobile-optimized (60%+ of sales happen on phones), abandoned cart recovery (15-27% recover lost sales). Get these six elements right, you win. Skip them, you lose. Simple as that.</p>

Most e-commerce website mistakes: poor product photos (no detail), weak descriptions (no SEO), slow checkout (abandonment 70%+), no cart recovery (lost revenue), no email capture (no retention).

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Photos, descriptions, reviews, videos</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Optimize product catalog: high-quality photos (6+ angles, zoom, lifestyle), detailed descriptions (benefits, specs, sizing), customer reviews with photos (4.5★+ average), product videos (how-to, unboxing). Poor catalog = no purchase = high returns. Quality catalog builds trust and reduces returns.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Fashion retailer had 2 photos per product, 50-word descriptions. Low conversion (1.8%), high returns (35%). Invested in catalog: 8 photos per product, 300-word benefits-focused descriptions, video demos. Conversion increased to 4.5% (150% improvement), returns decreased to 15% (57% reduction).</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Enable frictionless mobile checkout: Apple Pay/Google Pay (one-tap), guest checkout (no account required), auto-fill (browser, address), 3 steps max (cart → shipping → payment), progress indicator. Slow checkout = abandonment = lost revenue. Fast checkout captures mobile sales (60%+ traffic).</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Electronics store had 7-step checkout, account required, mobile-unfriendly. Abandonment 78%, mobile conversion 0.8%. Simplified to: Apple Pay, guest checkout, 3-step, mobile-optimized.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Implement cart recovery: email automation (1hr, 24hr, 72hr sequences), SMS reminders (same-day), exit-intent popup (10% off offer), retargeting ads. No cart recovery = 70% abandoned = lost revenue. Recovery campaigns capture 10-20% of abandoned carts.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Beauty brand had no cart recovery. 72% abandonment, losing $80k monthly. Added 3-email sequence (1hr: "Forgot something?", 24hr: "Still interested? 5% off", 72hr: "Last chance 10% off"), exit-intent popup.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Flows, segmentation, automation</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Integrate email marketing: welcome flow (10% off first purchase), abandoned cart (recovery), post-purchase (review request, cross-sell), win-back (inactive customers), segmentation (VIPs, new, churned). No email = no retention = low LTV. Email drives 30% of e-commerce revenue.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Home goods store had email newsletter only. Low engagement, no segmentation. Integrated Klaviyo: welcome flow (25% conversion), browse abandonment (12% recovery), post-purchase cross-sell (15% add-on rate), VIP tier (20% repeat). Email revenue increased from 5% to 28% of total, LTV increased 60%.</p>

          <p>Dropshipper selling home decor. 50 products. On Wix ($468/year). Site loading 4 seconds. Cart abandonment 75%. Doing $50K/month revenue, 2% conversion. Wanting to grow but losing customers to slow site.</p>
          <p class="font-bold mb-2 mt-4">Solution:</p>
          <p>Switched to Durable ($180/year). Compressed images, optimized code. Site loads in 1.5 seconds. Added free shipping threshold ($75+) to increase AOV. Mobile optimization (73% of traffic on mobile).</p>
          <p class="font-bold mb-2 mt-4">Results:</p>
          <ul class="space-y-1">
            <li>• Cart abandonment: 75% → 65% (10 percentage point drop)</li>
            <li>• Conversion increase: 2% → 2.5% (25% improvement)</li>
            <li>• Extra sales: 0.5% × 10K visitors = 50 extra sales/month</li>
            <li>• Avg order value: Increased from $50 to $65 (free shipping threshold)</li>
            <li>• Extra revenue: 50 sales × $65 = $3,250/month = $39K/year</li>
            <li>• Cost savings: $468 → $180 = $288/year saved</li>
            <li>• Total benefit: $39K + $288 = $39,288/year</li>
            <li>• Migration cost: 8 hours = $400 time value</li>
            <li>• ROI: $39,288 / ($180 + $400) = 67x return in year 1</li>
