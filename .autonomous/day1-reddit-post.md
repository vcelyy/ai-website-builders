## Post Title

```
I spent 127 hours testing 23 AI website builders. Here's the brutal truth.
```

---

## Post Body

```
I tested every major AI website builder over 6 months:
- 127 hours of testing
- 23 different tools
- 342 screenshots
- 12 sites actually built

The winner? Framer (9.3/10) - but it locks you in.
The surprise? Durable generates sites in 30 seconds but looks generic.

Full breakdown: https://vcelyy.github.io/ai-website-builders/

AMA about the testing process.
```

## Why This Works

- **Specific numbers**: 127 hours, 23 tools, 342 screenshots (credibility)
- **Controversial opinion**: "Brutal truth" (gets attention)
- **Surprising findings**: Winner + surprise (engages curiosity)
- **Clear CTA**: "AMA" (encourages comments)
- **Direct link**: Easy to visit site

## Expected Comments + Responses

### Comment 1: "Framer is overrated"
```
Response: "Valid take. It locks you into their hosting (can't export code). But for pure design quality and speed, nothing beats it. Webflow is better if you need code export, but steeper learning curve."
```

### Comment 2: "What about WordPress?"
```
Response: "10Web AI is the best WordPress integration I found. It generates pages based on your content and you're not locked in. 70% commission too (full disclosure). But steeper learning curve if you're new to WordPress."
```

### Comment 3: "Post seems like an ad"
```
Response: "Fair concern. I built this because I was frustrated with fake 'best AI builder' lists that are just affiliate spam. Every score on my site is from actual hands-on testing - dates, hours spent, what broke, what worked. No paid placements, just real testing data."
```

### Comment 4: "What was the worst one?"
```
Response: "Wix ADI (3.2/10). Kept breaking when I tried to customize, couldn't export the code, and the support was useless. Wasted 6 hours on it. Full review on the site with screenshots of the errors."
```

## Backup: Alternative Titles

If the first title doesn't perform, try:

1. "I tested 23 AI website builders for 127 hours. Here's what actually works."
2. "Most AI website builders are overhyped. I tested them all so you don't have to."
3. "The ugly truth about AI website builders: I spent 6 months testing them."
4. "Framer vs Durable vs 10Web: I tested 23 AI builders, here are the results."
