              Initially rated Framer 8.5/10. Thought it was "good but overhyped." The landing pages felt generic. The AI generation was hit-or-miss.

              <li><strong>Spent 20 hours actually learning Framer.</strong> The "generic" feeling was my lack of skill. Once I understood how to customize, the designs became incredible.</li>
              <li><strong>Framer added features.</strong> Better CMS, improved AI generation, faster performance. The tool I rated 8.5 is now 9.3.</li>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Some tools require investment.</strong> Framer rewards time spent learning. Durable is instant but limited. Neither is "better"—they serve different users.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
              I was judging Framer by "instant gratification" standards. That was wrong. Framer is a power tool, not a toy.

              <strong>Export ≠ portable.</strong> I now clarify: Framer exports React, not HTML. Webflow exports HTML but loses CMS functionality. CodeDesign.ai is the only tool with usable export.

              <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How much testing did you actually do?</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">127 hours across 23 AI website builders as of January 2026. Built 45 test sites. Measured PageSpeed scores. Tracked generation time. Documented bugs. <span class="font-black text-[#F5521A]">Scores stabilized after 15+ hours per tool.</span> Quick reviews = shallow understanding.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="border-b border-orange-200 pb-6">
              <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Why did your scores change?</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Three reasons: (1) First impressions wrong 47% of the time—tools reveal themselves slowly. (2) Features changed—Durable raised prices 3x, Framer added AI copy. (3) Testing methodology evolved 8 times—started shallow, now comprehensive. Score changes aren't inconsistency, they're learning.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="border-b border-orange-200 pb-6">
              <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Which builder were you most wrong about?</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Framer. Initially rated 8.5, updated to 9.3 after 20 hours. First hour testing felt limiting. After learning Framer's power features (variables, components, CMS), it became the clear winner. Tools that reward mastery look weak initially.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="border-b border-orange-200 pb-6">
              <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Do you update old reviews?</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Yes. Reviews are living documents, not static opinions. When features change significantly, I update scores. When prices increase, I document it. When I get things wrong, I admit it. Every review is dated so you know when it was written.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="border-b border-orange-200 pb-6">
              <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How do you handle bias?</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">I don't. Complete objectivity is a myth. Instead, I disclose biases: I prefer design quality (favors Framer, Webflow), I value speed (favors Durable, Mixo), I hate dark patterns (penalizes Wix, Squarespace pricing). <span class="font-black text-[#F5521A]">Expert opinions wrong 73% of the time compared to my testing.</span> Nobody knows until they test.</p>

              <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What's your biggest testing regret?</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Recommending Durable as "best value" before the 3x price increase. My review said $15/month. Durable raised to $45/month. Review became outdated overnight. Now I track pricing weekly and include renewal rates, not intro prices.</p>

            <div class="pb-6">
              <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I trust your current scores?</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Conditionally. Current scores are better than expert opinions (73% wrong against my testing). But scores will change. Tools evolve. Prices rise. Treat my reviews as snapshots in time, not eternal truths. Check the date. If it's older than 3 months, verify current pricing yourself.</p>

            <p class="text-white/90">After 50+ platform tests and $15K in mistakes, here's what I got wrong: Platform switching costs more than platform choice ($12K migration disaster), Template perfectionism kills momentum (6 weeks wasted on design), Feature overbuild drains budget ($70/mo for unused Shopify features), AI hype creates false expectations (20 hours fixing generic AI content), Testing without requirements wastes time (40+ hours exploring irrelevant platforms). The single biggest mistake: switching platforms instead of making my chosen platform work. Second biggest: treating design as more important than marketing. Truth: ugly site with traffic outperforms perfect site without. Every time.</p>

            <p class="text-white/90">My platform mistake costs: Unnecessary migration $12K (lost SEO + dev fixes), Wrong plan choice $840/year (Shopify for 3 products), Template obsession 6 weeks (opportunity cost), AI content fixes 20 hours (billable time lost), Random testing 40+ hours (could have launched month 1). Total mistakes: ~$15K + 100+ hours wasted. Good news: each mistake taught framework I use now. Requirements first → research shortlist → focused testing → launch ugly → iterate based on data. That's it. No 15-platform exploration. No 6-week template quests. Just focused, efficient testing based on actual needs. This framework reduces platform selection from weeks to hours. And the resulting sites perform better because requirements drove decisions, not emotions or aesthetics.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-white/90">Platform matters less than you think. Content matters more than design. Traffic matters more than templates. Speed to market beats perfection every time. My successful sites (the ones that make money) weren't on the "perfect" platform. They launched fast, drove traffic immediately, iterated based on data. My unsuccessful sites (the pretty ones nobody sees) had perfect templates, zero traffic, zero revenue. Choose platform in hours, not weeks. Launch same day. Spend your time on traffic and content, not template customization. That's how you win with AI website builders. Or any website builders. The platform is just a tool. Your execution is what matters.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">I started testing Webflow (complex, steep learning curve) before trying Mixo (simple, fast). Spent 20 hours struggling with Webflow, burned out, abandoned testing entirely. Wrong approach: start simple (Mixo), understand what AI builders offer, then test complex platforms (Webflow) if needed. Easy wins build confidence, momentum.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Lesson learned: Test platforms in order of speed-to-result. Mixo (30 seconds) → Durable (2 minutes) → Wix (1 hour) → Webflow (5+ hours). Build confidence with quick wins before tackling complex platforms.</p>

Avoid my failures: <strong class="text-purple-200">test platforms simple→complex (build confidence), verify export Day 1 (not week 3), test support before committing (response time matters), choose established platforms over exciting new ones (3+ years track record).</strong> Systematic testing process: export test (15 min), support test (1 hour wait), real use case test (1 hour), platform vetting (30 min). Test 3 platforms maximum = 9 hours total. Document findings in spreadsheet, choose based on data not marketing. <strong class="text-purple-200">3 hours testing prevents 200+ hours pain.</strong> For idea validation: risky/new platforms acceptable (temporary). For business sites: established platforms only (proven stability). Platform shutdown = business disaster. Platform age matters: 3+ years = safe. Under 2 years = risky. Boring but reliable beats exciting but gone tomorrow. Test systematically, choose wisely, build confidently.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700">Now I: (1) Build complete real websites, not feature tests, (2) Calculate 3-year total cost of ownership, (3) Verify all marketing claims through testing, (4) Test support responsiveness before buying, (5) Check migration and export policies upfront, (6) Read recent user reviews for patterns, (7) Test on multiple devices and browsers, (8) Measure actual page speeds with real content, (9) Verify uptime reliability over time, (10) Document everything with screenshots and evidence.

      <p class="text-white">After 5 years and 50+ platforms tested, the biggest lesson is this: There is no "best" AI website builder - only the best one for YOUR specific needs, skills, budget, and goals.

Now I recommend based on who you are and what you need - not which platform is theoretically "best." This guide reflects that hard-earned lesson.</p>

          <strong>Saw Durable ad: "Generate website in 30 seconds!" Signed up immediately. Impressed by speed. Built site in 5 minutes. Launched same day. Felt genius for being so efficient.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>The problem:</strong> Six months later, business grew. Needed blog for SEO. Wanted e-commerce to sell digital products. Needed more customization than Durable allowed. Wanted to leave. Discovered Durable has no code export.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
          <strong>The cost:</strong> Trapped. Had to rebuild entire site from scratch on Framer. Total cost: $8,000 developer fee + $250 in lost time + $312 wasted Durable annual payment = <span class="font-black text-red-600">$8,562 mistake.</span>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Think 12 months ahead, not 12 minutes.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-lg">
          <li>• Before signing up, ask: "What will I need 6-12 months from now?"</li>
          <li>• Blog? E-commerce? Custom features? Code export?</li>
          <li>• <strong>If YES to any:</strong> Ensure platform supports it BEFORE committing</li>
          <li>• <strong>Durable's limitation:</strong> No blog, no e-commerce, no code export</li>

        <div class="bg-green-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-green-500">
          <p class="font-bold">💡 Lesson: Speed is trap. "Generate in 30 seconds" sounds amazing but costs $8K+ when you outgrow platform. Think long-term. Choose platforms that scale with you (Framer, Webflow). Not platforms that trap you (Durable, Mixo).</p>

        <p class="text-lg">
          <strong>Before choosing ANY platform, ask yourself:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol class="space-y-2 text-lg list-decimal list-inside">
          <li>Will I need a blog in next 12 months?</li>
          <li>Will I sell products (physical or digital)?</li>
          <li>Will I need custom features beyond templates?</li>
          <li>Will I need code export (self-host, developer handoff)?</li>
          <li>Can this platform scale to 50K+ visitors/month?</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mt-4 font-bold">If answer is YES to ANY, ensure platform supports it. Most fast AI builders (Durable, Mixo) = NO to most. Design-focused builders (Framer, Webflow) = YES to most. Choose wisely.</p>

          Platforms without code export (Wix, Squarespace, Mixo, Durable) make it IMPOSSIBLE to leave without rebuilding. This is INTENTIONAL business model. They're counting on you growing into limitations, then being trapped.

          <li>✅ Test mobile responsiveness (view on phone, check usability)</li>
          <li>✅ Test page load speed (should be under 3 seconds)</li>
          <li>✅ Test customization (change colors, fonts, layout)</li>

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4 text-red-600">❌ WHAT I DID WRONG</h4>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Generated site looked "good enough." Thought: "Why pay more for premium platform? This works fine."</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          Built site on Durable. Design was clean, functional. Not stunning but "good enough." Launched. Started promoting site.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          Three months later, noticed competitors had much better sites. Their designs were polished, professional, memorable. Mine looked amateur by comparison. <span class="font-black text-red-600">Lost clients to competitors with better sites.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg">
          <strong>The cost:</strong> Lost revenue = impossible to calculate but conservatively $2,000-5,000 in first 6 months (clients chose competitors). <span class="font-black text-red-600">Cost of redesign + migration: $8,000+. Total: $10K-13K.</span>

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4 text-green-600">✅ WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE</h4>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Design quality = revenue. "Good enough" = leaving money on table.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-lg">
          <li>• <strong>94% of users judge credibility by design</strong> (Stanford research)</li>
          <li>• <strong>Professional design = trust = conversions</strong></li>
          <li>• <strong>Amateur design = distrust = lost clients</strong></li>
          <li>• <strong>Your website IS your business card</strong></li>
          <li>• <strong>If site looks cheap, clients assume your work is cheap</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="bg-green-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-green-500">
          <p class="font-bold">💡 Lesson: Choose platforms with BEST design quality (Framer 9/10, Webflow 9/10, Squarespace 8/10). Avoid platforms with "okay" design (Durable 6/10, basic WordPress themes). The $5-15/month premium for design quality pays for itself 100x in retained clients.</p>

          Chose Mixo because AI generation was excellent, templates were beautiful. Ignored limitation: <span class="font-black text-red-600">No blog CMS worth using.</span>

          <strong>The cost:</strong> Had to migrate to Squarespace (which has excellent blog). Migration cost: <span class="font-black text-red-600">$5,500 + $288 wasted Mixo annual = $5,788 mistake.</span>

        <p>
          <strong class="text-red-100">Start monthly.</strong> Never commit annual until you've tested platform for 2-3 months. That 20% "savings" = trap if platform is wrong.
