          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Jennifer Walsh runs Walsh Estate Planning in San Diego. 12 years experience, boutique practice, excellent client care. Website: generic law firm template, "estate planning services" vague, process not explained, credentials buried in footer, consultation form difficult to find. Result: 22 inquiries/month, $38,000 revenue, mostly referrals. Problem: families planning estates search online = never find Walsh. Competitors with clear services and process get the calls. Walsh: "I'm great at what I do, but families don't know I exist. My website looks like every other law firm - no personality, no clarity."</p>

Total investment: $4,200 (Webflow subscription 1 year + designer). Build time: 5 days. Walsh: "I focused on clarity and trust building. Families are nervous about estate planning - they need comfort and confidence."</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Month 1 results: 58 inquiries (up from 22, 164% increase), $82,000 revenue. Google ranking: page 1 position 3 for "San Diego estate planning attorney." Services clear: families know exactly what Walsh does = call for their specific need. Process visible: comfort = trust = hire. Credentials prominent: qualified = safe = choose over competitor. Testimonials front and center: social proof = others trusted her = I trust her. Free consultation: risk-free = book now instead of delaying. Mobile booking: family discussion = search together = book immediately. Walsh: "Clear website = legitimate practice = trust = inquiries. Before: invisible despite excellent work. After: families see services, understand process, feel comfortable = hire. Best $4,200 I ever spent." Month 3: 91 inquiries/month, $142,000 revenue.

          <p class="text-gray-700">Site lists "estate planning" without specifics. Family searching "living trust attorney" - does Walsh do that? Unclear = they call competitor. Fix: List services explicitly: "Living Trusts, Last Will & Testament, Power of Attorney, Healthcare Directives, Trust Administration." Specific services = they call you for their need.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Attorney has no visible process. Family: "what happens when I hire you?" Unclear = anxiety = call competitor with clear steps. Fix: Add "Step 1: Free Consultation, Step 2: Custom Plan, Step 3: Draft Documents, Step 4: Signing & Funding" prominently. Process visible = comfort = trust = hire.</p>
