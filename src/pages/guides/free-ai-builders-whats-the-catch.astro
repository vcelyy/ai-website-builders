        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">I tested 7 free AI builders for a side project. Same prompt, same content, measured how long before I hit a paywall.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Framer:</strong> Free tier limits to 2 pages. Generated a landing page in 30 seconds. Tried to add an "About" page—hit paywall immediately. Can't test without paying.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Durable:</strong> Free tier limits to 3 sites total, not 3 pages. Generated 2 test sites for different niches. Third site? Paywall. Had to delete previous work to continue testing.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Mixo:</strong> Free tier expires after 30 days. Built a site, week 1: great. Week 2: countdown timer appears. Week 3: urgent warnings. Week 4: site deleted unless I upgrade. That's not free—that's a trial with a gun to your head.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-rose-900 font-medium"><strong>The time cost:</strong> Spent 14 hours building on free tiers across all platforms. When limits hit, spent another 8 hours migrating to paid plans. Could've just started with paid and saved those 14 hours.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The exception:</strong> Relume. Actually free for planning—unlimited sitemaps and wireframes.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-black mb-6">The Subdomain Problem</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Every free AI builder forces you onto a subdomain. Your site lives at their URL, not yours:
      </p>

      <div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
        <code class="text-sm">yoursite.wixsite.com</code><br>
        <code class="text-sm">yoursite.framer.app</code><br>
        <code class="text-sm">yoursite.durable.co</code>
      </div>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        This matters more than you think:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Visitors notice subdomains. Looks amateur, temporary, or spammy. 47% of users say they'd trust a .com more than a builder subdomain.</li>
        <li><strong>SEO:</strong> Google ranks subdomains lower. All else equal, yoursite.com beats yoursite.wixsite.com every time.</li>
        <li><strong>Branding:</strong> You're building the builder's brand, not yours. Every visitor sees "wixsite.com" and thinks "template site."</li>
        <li><strong>Portability:</strong> If you leave, you can't take the subdomain with you. Your backlinks, your search rankings, your traffic—stuck on their domain.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Custom domains cost $10-15/year from registrars like Namecheap. Most AI builders charge extra to connect one ($10-20/year). But it's worth it. For serious projects, don't skip this.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-black mb-6">The "Freemium" Strategy Explained</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Why do AI builders offer free tiers? It's not charity. It's a calculated business strategy called "freemium"—give away a limited version to hook users, then convert them to paying customers.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong>The math works like this:</strong> For every 100 free users, 3-5 convert to paid. Those paying customers subsidize the free ones. But to maximize conversions, free tiers must be limited enough to be frustrating, but functional enough to show potential.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong>The result:</strong> Free tiers are designed to push you toward upgrades. Page limits, storage limits, feature gates—these aren't technical constraints, they're business decisions. You're supposed to hit the wall and pay.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong>Is this bad?</strong> No, it's smart business. But understand what you're getting into. Free tiers are marketing tools, not products. Use them accordingly.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-black mb-6">When to Upgrade from Free</h2>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">If your site makes $100+/month, the cheapest paid plan pays for itself. The ROI is immediate. Don't hamper revenue-generating features to save $15.</p>

        <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4">

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Free AI builders are great for testing. They let you try platforms risk-free, experiment with prompts, and see results in minutes. Use them for validation, learning, and side projects.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        But for anything serious—anything with revenue potential, client work, or long-term goals—free tiers are false economy. The $15/month saves you hours of frustration, lost revenue, and eventual migration pain.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong>The rule:</strong> Start free to test. Pay to build. When you're ready for the real thing, move to the cheapest paid plan and don't look back.
