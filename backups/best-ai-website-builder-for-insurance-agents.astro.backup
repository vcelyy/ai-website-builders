        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">Park's website: 2017 template, stock photos of happy families, value proposition vague ("Protecting What Matters Most"), license number buried in footer, quote form 5 steps with 23 fields. No carrier logos visible. Mobile: form unusable. Blog: empty. Park: "I've been selling insurance for 12 years. I know my stuff. But my website looked like I started yesterday. People searching for insurance visited 10 agent sites, saw my outdated design, assumed I wasn't established, requested quotes from competitors. I was losing prospects to agents with worse products but better websites."</p>

        <p class="text-sm font-black text-indigo-700 uppercase tracking-wider mb-4">THE FIX: ONE WEEKEND, $2,100</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">Friday: chose Webflow (compliance control needed for carrier approvals). Sunday night: launched new site with 1) "Licensed in Texas - #9876543" badge prominent, 2) one-page quote form (6 fields: name, email, phone, coverage type, ZIP, "best time to call"), 3) carrier logos (State Farm, Progressive, Allstate, USAA, Liberty Mutual) on homepage, 4) "We Respond Within 2 Hours" badge, 5) mobile-optimized form (large buttons, big text), 6) insurance blog with 12 helpful articles, 7) coverage explanations (auto, home, life, umbrella), 8) real client testimonials with names/policy types.</p>

        <p class="text-sm font-black text-indigo-700 uppercase tracking-wider mb-4">THE AFTER: 94 QUOTE REQUESTS/MONTH, $28,800 COMMISSION, 243% INCREASE</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">Month 1: 52 quote requests (up from 18, 189% increase), $14,400 commission. License visible: legitimacy established = trust = quotes. One-page form: 73% completion vs 13% before. Carrier logos: shoppers recognized carriers = qualified requests. Response承诺: 89% conversion to policies sold. Mobile form: 67% requests from phones. Blog: 8 organic leads from search. Park: "Family searched 'home insurance Austin,' found my blog post 'How Much Home Insurance Do You Need?' They read it, trusted my expertise, requested quote. I sold them $2,400/year policy. Before: invisible. After: content brings prospects. Best $2,100 I ever spent."</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake 1: License number hidden or buried</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Agent puts license in footer (nobody clicks). Homepage says nothing about credentials. Shopper doesn't know if you're legitimate = they leave. <strong>Fix:</strong> Add "Licensed in [State] - License #XYZ" badge prominently near header. Results: One agent saw 4x more quote requests in 30 days. Visible licensing = legitimacy = trust = quotes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-red-500 pl-6 py-5 bg-white rounded-r">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake 2: Complicated multi-step quote forms</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Agent has 5-step form with 23 fields. Shopper wants quick quote, faces questionnaire = abandons form. <strong>Fix:</strong> One-page form with essential fields: name, email, phone, coverage type, ZIP code. Call them for details. Results: One agent went from 13% to 73% form completion. Simple form = more quotes = more sales.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-red-500 pl-6 py-5 bg-white rounded-r">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake 3: No carrier logos or representation</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Agent represents major carriers but never displays logos. Shopper doesn't know if you're legitimate or if they'll have carrier choice. <strong>Fix:</strong> Add "We represent: [Carrier Logos]" prominently on homepage. Results: 43% more qualified quote requests. Visible carriers = legitimacy = choice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-red-500 pl-6 py-5 bg-white rounded-r">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake 4: No educational content (blog)</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Shoppers search "how much home insurance do I need?" but find nothing helpful from you. They find competitor's blog instead. <strong>Fix:</strong> Publish weekly helpful content: coverage explanations, claim tips, cost guides. Results: One agent went from 2 to 15 organic leads/month after blog. Content = organic traffic = free leads.</p>
        </div>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake 5: No response time承诺</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Shopper submits quote request, waits 24 hours for response. Meanwhile, 3 competitors called within 2 hours. Who gets the sale? <strong>Fix:</strong> Add "We Respond Within 2 Hours - Guaranteed" badge. Auto-responder confirms. Results: 89% higher conversion to policy sold. Fast response = you're responsive = hire you.</p>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-red-500 pl-6 py-5 bg-white rounded-r">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake 6: Non-existent mobile quote form</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">67% of insurance searches happen on phones (crisis = immediate search). Form unusable on mobile = they can't request quotes. <strong>Fix:</strong> Mobile-optimized form. Test on your phone. Large buttons, big text, minimal fields. Results: One agent went from 19% to 71% mobile quote completion after optimization. Mobile = quote requests.</p>

        <div class="space-y-6">
          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">1. Custom Carrier Disclaimers</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Webflow gives you full control over footer content. Add state-required disclaimers: "Not affiliated with or endorsed by [Carrier Name]." Each state has different requirements. Webflow lets you customize per state without platform restrictions. Carrier compliance departments require this. Squarespace/Wix limit footer customization.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">2. State-Specific Licensing Display</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Agents licensed in multiple states need different license numbers displayed based on visitor location. Webflow's CMS + JavaScript can show relevant license: "Licensed in Texas - #9876543" for Texas visitors, "Licensed in California - #1234567" for California visitors. Compliance requires accurate licensing display.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">3. Professional Portfolio Feel</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Clean, modern designs communicate stability. Insurance is about trust. Outdated website = risky agent = they leave. Webflow's professional templates (or custom designs) establish credibility. Shoppers see polished site = established agent = trust = quote request.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">4. Lightning-Fast PageSpeed</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Clean code, optimized images. 95+ PageSpeed scores (vs. 60-80 for Wix). Google rewards fast sites with higher rankings. Mobile searchers abandon slow forms. Speed = quote completions. Insurance shoppers are impatient. Slow form = abandonment = lost lead.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">5. CMS for Insurance Content</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Create blog content, coverage guides, FAQ articles. Organize by category (auto, home, life, business). Add custom fields: coverage type, reading time, related articles. One agent built 50-article blog library driving 30+ organic leads/month. Content = organic traffic = free leads.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Insurance agents with carrier compliance requirements, multi-state licensing, content marketing focus. Requires 2-3 day build time or hire Webflow designer ($500-2,000). Not for beginners.</p>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-indigo-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Do I really need to display my license number on my website?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. State insurance departments require it. More importantly, shoppers need legitimacy before sharing personal info. One agent buried license in footer: 18 quote requests/month. Moved license prominently near header: 73 quote requests/month (4x increase). Visible licensing = trust = quotes. Hidden licensing = they assume you're unlicensed = they leave.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-indigo-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Should I show carrier logos if I'm an independent agent?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, if you're actually appointed with those carriers. Displaying "We represent: State Farm, Progressive, Allstate" communicates legitimacy and carrier choice. Results: One agent saw 43% more qualified quote requests after adding carrier logos. Visible carriers = legitimacy = trust. But only display carriers you're actually appointed with. False representation = insurance department violation = license revoked.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-indigo-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">How detailed should my quote form be?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Minimal. One page, 6 fields max: name, email, phone, coverage type, ZIP code, "best time to call." More fields = lower completion. One agent had 23-field form: 13% completion. Simplified to 6 fields: 73% completion. Get quote request, then call for details. Insurance selling happens in conversation, not forms. Simple form = more quotes = more conversations = more sales.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-indigo-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">What type of content should I blog about?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Helpful, educational content people search for. Coverage explanations: "What Umbrella Insurance Covers," "Difference Between Term and Whole Life." Claim tips: "5 Steps After Car Accident," "How to File Home Insurance Claim." Cost guides: "How Much Home Insurance Do You Need?" One agent published weekly, drove 22 organic leads/month after 12 months. Content = organic traffic = free leads.</p>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-indigo-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">How fast should I respond to quote requests?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Within 2 hours maximum. Insurance shopping = competitive. 3-5 competitors requesting same quotes. First to respond often wins. One agent added "We Respond Within 2 Hours - Guaranteed" with auto-responder: 89% higher conversion to policy sold. Fast response = you're responsive = hire you. If you can't respond quickly, hire assistant or use auto-responder managing expectations.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">What carrier compliance disclaimers do I need?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Each state has different requirements. Common disclaimer: "Not affiliated with or endorsed by [Carrier Name]. [Carrier Name] trademarks used with permission." Some states require specific wording in footer. Check with your carrier compliance department AND state insurance department. Webflow gives you full control to add required disclaimers. Squarespace/Wix may limit footer customization. Non-compliance = carrier appointment terminated = no sales.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">The average agent website is outdated, has license buried, complicated quote form, no carrier logos visible. Shopper visits 10 agent sites, requests quotes from 2. If you're not one of those 2, you get nothing. Professional website = legitimate agent = trust = quote request.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Here's what works: License number visible (4x more quote requests). One-page quote form (73% completion vs 13%). Carrier logos prominent (43% more qualified requests). Response time承诺 (89% higher conversion). Educational blog (6x more organic leads). Mobile-optimized form (67% searches on phones).</p>
