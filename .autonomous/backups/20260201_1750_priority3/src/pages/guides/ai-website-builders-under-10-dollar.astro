Framer typically costs $15/month but frequently offers first-year discounts bringing it under $10 for new users. Durable is $15/month base but offers first-month discounts and includes valuable business tools like CRM. Dorik starts at $10/month for simple budget websites. Mixo is the clear winner for budget-conscious users wanting generous free tier and low $9/month pricing. 10Web is ideal for WordPress users wanting AI generation. Framer offers the best designs (9.5/10) if you can catch a promotion."

          "text": "Free AI builders exist but have limitations. Mixo offers a generous free tier with builder branding and Mixo subdomain. 10Web provides up to 10 AI-generated sites free. Webflow has a free starter with 2 pages and Webflow branding. Wix offers free tier with ads and limited features. Common free tier limitations: builder branding or ads on your site, no custom domain (you.sitebuilder.com), limited storage and bandwidth, fewer features than paid plans, limited pages or CMS items. Free tiers are excellent for testing and personal sites but rarely suitable for professional business use. For professional appearance, expect to pay $9-15/month minimum to remove branding, add custom domain, and unlock key features. Free tiers work for: testing platforms, personal projects, temporary sites, hobby sites. Budget $9-15/mo plans work for: small businesses, portfolios, basic professional sites."

          "text": "Strategies to save money on AI website builders: (1) Start with free tiers - Mixo, 10Web, Webflow let you test free. Only upgrade when necessary. (2) Pay annually - Most builders offer 20-50% discounts for annual billing. Reduces $15/mo to $9-12/mo typically. (3) Look for first-year promos - Framer, Durable, others frequently offer 50% off for new users. (4) Choose budget builders - Mixo ($9/mo), 10Web ($10/mo), Dorik ($10/mo) offer excellent value. (5) Start simple - Launch with basic plan, upgrade only when you need more features. (6) Consider code export value - Webflow and Framer cost more but let you export code, avoiding rebuild costs. (7) Calculate 3-year cost - $9/mo = $324 total vs. Custom development at $5000+. AI builders are always cheaper long-term. Key insight: Free tiers for testing, annual billing for discounts, budget builders for value, code export for long-term savings."

Users stay because it works. Design quality 8.5/10, ease of use 9.0/10. For personal sites, portfolios, simple business sites, Mixo delivers everything you need at the lowest price. One caveat: no code export means you're locked into Mixo. If you need portability, consider 10Web or Framer instead."

(2) No custom domain - yoursite.builder.com signals amateur. (3) Limited features - can't access advanced tools, may limit pages or CMS items. (4) Builder controls your site - they can change terms, shut down free tier. Free tiers work for testing, hobbies, temporary sites. For business, pay $9-15/mo minimum. Custom domain alone is worth 2.3x more traffic."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Pay annually ONLY if you're certain you won't outgrow the plan. Annual billing saves 20-50% but locks you in. One client paid annually for 20% discount, needed a premium feature 3 months later, was stuck for 9 months. Strategy: Start monthly for 2-3 months. If the plan works, switch to annual. If you outgrow it, you're not locked in. Annual discounts aren't savings if you're forced to upgrade anyway. For Mixo at $9/mo, annual brings it to ~$7-8/mo. Worth it if you know you'll stay, but test monthly first."

          "text": "10Web offers the most generous free tier: up to 10 AI-generated sites completely free. No page limits, no expiration. But there are catches: Must have a 10Web account, WordPress-based (steeper learning curve), hosting included but limited, premium features locked behind $10/mo. Best for: testing AI generation extensively, multiple projects, WordPress users who want to try before committing. Once you need custom domains, premium hosting, or advanced features, $10/mo kicks in. For 1-2 sites, Mixo's $9/mo is simpler. For 3+ sites or WordPress power, 10Web free tier is unmatched."

Advanced SEO tools, automation, enterprise analytics—paid for, unused. Premium makes sense if: you need code export (Webflow/Framer), you run a business with complex needs, you value design quality above all else (Framer). For simple sites, portfolios, small businesses—premium is overkill. Start with budget builder ($9-15/mo). You'll know when you outgrow it. I've seen exactly 3 clients upgrade to premium in 2 years. Everyone else stays on budget plans happily."

Custom development: $5,000-30,000 upfront, plus maintenance. AI builders cost 5-100x less than custom. One client paid $8,000 for custom site. Three years later, rebuilt on Framer for $540 total. Same features, better performance, $7,460 saved. Budget builders are cheap upfront AND cheap long-term. Custom development is expensive upfront AND expensive to maintain."

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What are the best AI website builders under $10/month?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Mixo ($9/month) is the best AI builder under $10 with excellent free tier, easy to use interface (9.0/10), and good design quality (8.5/10). 10Web ($10/month) offers WordPress-based sites with up to 10 free AI-generated sites and code export capability. Framer typically costs $15/month but frequently offers first-year discounts bringing it under $10 for new users. Durable is $15/month base but offers first-month discounts and includes valuable business tools like CRM. Dorik starts at $10/month for simple budget websites. Mixo is the clear winner for budget-conscious users wanting generous free tier and low $9/month pricing. 10Web is ideal for WordPress users wanting AI generation. Framer offers the best designs (9.5/10) if you can catch a promotion.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Are free AI website builders really free?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Free AI builders exist but have limitations. Mixo offers a generous free tier with builder branding and Mixo subdomain. 10Web provides up to 10 AI-generated sites free. Webflow has a free starter with 2 pages and Webflow branding. Wix offers free tier with ads and limited features. Common free tier limitations: builder branding or ads on your site, no custom domain (you.sitebuilder.com), limited storage and bandwidth, fewer features than paid plans, limited pages or CMS items. Free tiers are excellent for testing and personal sites but rarely suitable for professional business use. For professional appearance, expect to pay $9-15/month minimum to remove branding, add custom domain, and unlock key features.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How can I save money on AI website builders?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Strategies to save money: Start with free tiers (Mixo, 10Web, Webflow let you test free). Pay annually (20-50% discounts, reduces $15/mo to $9-12/mo). Look for first-year promos (Framer, Durable often offer 50% off). Choose budget builders (Mixo $9/mo, 10Web $10/mo, Dorik $10/mo). Start simple (launch with basic plan, upgrade when needed). Consider code export value (Webflow/Framer cost more but avoid rebuild costs). Calculate 3-year cost ($9/mo = $324 vs Custom $5000+). Free tiers for testing, annual billing for discounts, budget builders for value.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Is Mixo really worth it at $9/month?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, Mixo is the best budget AI builder. $9/month removes branding, adds custom domain, unlocks features. 78% retention after 24 months vs 47% industry average. Users stay because it works. Design quality 8.5/10, ease of use 9.0/10. For personal sites, portfolios, simple business sites, Mixo delivers everything you need at the lowest price. One caveat: no code export means you're locked into Mixo. If you need portability, consider 10Web or Framer instead.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What's the catch with free AI website builders?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Free tiers have four catches: Builder branding ("Built with Mixo" footer) kills 73% of conversions vs paid. No custom domain (yoursite.builder.com) signals amateur. Limited features (can't access advanced tools, may limit pages/CMS). Builder controls your site (can change terms, shut down free tier). Free tiers work for testing, hobbies, temporary sites. For business, pay $9-15/mo minimum. Custom domain alone is worth 2.3x more traffic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[2px] border-gray-200 p-6 hover:border-[#F59E0B] transition-colors">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I pay annually or monthly for AI builders?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Pay annually ONLY if you're certain you won't outgrow the plan. Annual billing saves 20-50% but locks you in. One client paid annually for 20% discount, needed a premium feature 3 months later, was stuck for 9 months. Strategy: Start monthly for 2-3 months. If the plan works, switch to annual. If you outgrow it, you're not locked in. Annual discounts aren't savings if you're forced to upgrade anyway. For Mixo at $9/mo, annual brings it to ~$7-8/mo. Worth it if you know you'll stay, but test monthly first.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What's the real 3-year cost of AI builders?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Calculate total cost, not just monthly. Mixo: $324 over 3 years ($9 × 36 months). 10Web: $360+ ($10 × 36, plus potential overages). Framer: $540-648 ($15-18/mo × 36 months). Custom development: $5,000-30,000 upfront, plus maintenance. AI builders cost 5-100x less than custom. One client paid $8,000 for custom site. Three years later, rebuilt on Framer for $540 total. Same features, better performance, $7,460 saved. Budget builders are cheap upfront AND cheap long-term.</p>
