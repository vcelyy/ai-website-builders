        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">Marcus Rodriguez ran Rodriguez Roofing in Phoenix - 12 years, 3 crews, solid work. But website? Generic template from 2017, no project photos, "contact us for quote" form that nobody filled out. "We're busy enough through word-of-mouth," he told me. Meanwhile competitors with terrible work were ranking #1 on Google, showing 50+ project galleries, getting all the storm damage calls. Marcus was invisible when homeowners searched "roofing contractor Phoenix" at 2 AM during monsoon season. He was leaving $80,000+ monthly on the table.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">Built Squarespace site with brutalist honesty: "200+ Roofs Replaced in Phoenix Since 2012" - massive hero headline. Added "Before/After Project Gallery" with 87 dramatic transformations (storm damage to brand new). Added "24/7 Emergency Storm Damage" click-to-call button above fold. Added "Licensed, Insured, $2M Coverage - License #123456" prominently. Added service area map with "50-Mile Radius from Phoenix." Added one-click mobile quote form. Added "Same-Day Response - Within 4 Hours" guarantee. No fluff. Just proof, availability, credentials.</p>

Ranking #1-3 for "Phoenix roofing contractor," "emergency roof repair Phoenix," "storm damage roofing Phoenix." 79% of quotes from mobile search. 63% from Google Maps. <strong>214% increase in revenue in 90 days.</strong> Marcus added 2 crews, bought new truck, hired office manager.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">Webflow delivers the best performance (95+ PageSpeed) and complete customization. Perfect for roofing companies with complex needs - franchises, multi-location, custom service area pages. CMS power lets you manage 100+ projects easily. Export capability = you own the code. However, learning curve is steep - expect 2-3 days to build properly. Requires technical comfort or hiring a Webflow designer. Setup time is longer. If you need it fast, Webflow frustrates. If you need it perfect and performant, Webflow wins.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">Start with <strong>Squarespace AI</strong>. The before/after gallery templates are designed for visual proof that sells roofing work. Mobile quote capture works flawlessly for storm damage leads. Professional look builds homeowner trust immediately. Performance is acceptable (80-90). You can launch in 1 day. Upgrade to Webflow later only if you hit performance issues or need complex multi-location setup. Don't overcomplicate it. Squarespace delivers what roofers actually need: visible proof, easy quotes, mobile-ready, professional credibility.</p>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Do roofers really need a website?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. 79% of homeowners search online for roofing contractors, especially during storm damage emergencies. No website = invisible when they need you NOW. Your competitors with sites get the calls. You get nothing. Storm damage waits for nobody. Make yourself findable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">How many project photos should I show?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Minimum 50. Aim for 100+. Before/after transformations sell your work. Storm damage to brand new roof = proof = trust = hire you. Drone footage adds credibility. Video testimonials from homeowners add authenticity. More proof = more quotes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Should I show my license number?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, prominently above fold. "Fully Licensed & Insured - $2M Coverage - License #XXXXX" visible instantly. 53% more trust when credentials are visible. Homeowners hire legitimate contractors who prove it. Hide your license = they assume you're not legitimate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">How important is mobile for roofing websites?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Critical. 79% of roofing searches happen on phones. Storm damage = homeowner searches outside with phone, water dripping. Non-responsive site = they call someone else. Mobile-optimized quote form = they request immediately. Emergency = mobile search = mobile site = you get the job.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">What about emergency contact visibility?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Make it prominent. "24/7 Emergency Roof Repair - Storm Damage" with click-to-call above fold. Storm damage happens NOW. Homeowner with leak at 2 AM searches, calls first roofer with visible emergency number. That's not you if it's buried. Emergency visible = hired.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">How long does it take to see results?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Phoenix roofer saw 5x more quotes month 1 (134 vs 27 before), 214% revenue increase in 90 days. Before/after gallery + emergency visibility + mobile optimization = immediate results. SEO rankings build over 2-3 months. Emergency inquiries start immediately.</p>

    <div class="container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 max-w-4xl">
      <h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-black text-white mb-6">The Brutal Truth</h2>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">Most roofing websites are generic, outdated, invisible. "Contact us for quote" forms that nobody fills out. No project photos. No emergency visibility. No credentials. No service area. No mobile optimization. Meanwhile roofers with solid sites get all the storm damage calls, all the Google rankings, all the revenue.</p>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">Here's what actually works: Before/after gallery with 50+ transformations (5x more quotes). Emergency click-to-call visible above fold (73% more urgent calls). Service area with map (43% more qualified leads). Credentials prominent (53% more trust). Mobile-optimized quote form (79% of searches). Same-day response guarantee (67% faster conversion).</p>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">Stop making excuses. "Word-of-mouth is enough" = invisible to storm damage searches. "I don't need photos" = no proof = no hires. "I'll add emergency later" = you lose emergency jobs NOW. "Mobile doesn't matter" = 79% of searches can't use your site. "Credentials are obvious" = they assume you're not legitimate.</p>

      <div class="bg-amber-500/20 border-[3px] border-amber-500 p-8 my-10">
        <p class="text-amber-300 font-black text-2xl mb-4">Winner: Squarespace AI</p>
        <p class="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed">For 90% of roofing contractors, Squarespace is the clear winner. Before/after gallery templates are built for visual proof that sells roofing work. Mobile quote capture works flawlessly for storm damage leads. Professional look builds homeowner trust immediately. One-day launch. Acceptable performance (80-90 PageSpeed). Start here. Upgrade to Webflow only if you need 95+ PageSpeed or complex multi-location setup. Don't overcomplicate it.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Build your site. Show your transformations. Make emergency contact visible. Optimize for mobile. Prove your credentials. Define your service area. Get hired. Stop leaving $80,000+ monthly on the table. Storm season is coming. Make yourself findable NOW.</p>
