## TECHNICAL SEO FINDINGS

### Schema Markup Opportunities

- **Review aggregation** - Can add aggregate rating for homepage
- **Breadcrumb schema** - Already implemented, verify
- **Organization schema** - Add to site for brand knowledge panel
- **FAQ schema** - Implemented on reviews, add to more pages

### Internal Linking Gaps
- Some long-tail pages lack sufficient internal links
- Category pages could link to more specific content
- Homepage could feature more long-tail pages

### Page Speed Considerations
- Current build time: ~4s for 52 pages
- At 70 pages: ~5-6s expected (still acceptable)
- Image optimization needed for screenshot-heavy pages

## CONTENT QUALITY STANDARDS

Based on competitor analysis and user feedback:

### Anti-AI-Slop Rules (Enforce)
1. Real testing anecdotes required
2. Specific data (not "fast" but "0.9s load time")
3. Honest pros/cons (not affiliate fluff)
4. Personal voice (first-person perspective)
5. Visual evidence (screenshots, build videos)
6. Freshness timestamps ("Updated: January 2025")
7. Unique angles (not repeating competitor content)

### Content Differentiation Strategy
- **Hands-on proof**: 127+ hours tested, 23 sites built
- **Personal stories**: "I built X for Y client, here's what happened"
- **Technical depth**: PageSpeed scores, feature comparisons, export tests
- ** Brutalist design**: Standing out from corporate competitors
- **No corporate fluff**: "Look, I'll be honest" tone
