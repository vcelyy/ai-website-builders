          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "For ticketing, you have three main approaches: (1) Integrated solutions - Eventbrite embeds work with all AI builders, provide professional ticketing, handle payments and check-ins, but charge fees (3.5% + $1.79/ticket). (2) Direct payment - Stripe integration through Webflow, Squarespace Commerce, or custom forms. Lower fees (2.9% + $0.30), but requires manual attendee management. (3) Hybrid approach - Use Eventbrite for initial ticketing, then export attendee list. Combine ease of setup with cost efficiency. For free events, use built-in forms (Typeform, Google Forms) or form builders to collect RSVPs and attendee info. For paid events under 100 attendees, Stripe direct is most cost-effective. For events over 100 attendees, Eventbrite's management features justify the fees."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Both approaches work depending on event complexity. Simple events (weddings, private parties, workshops) should use built-in forms - Mixo, Squarespace, and Webflow have form builders that collect registrations without friction. Keep visitors on your site, capture all data directly, control the experience. Complex events (multi-track conferences, festivals with multiple ticket types) benefit from external platforms like Eventbrite - specialized features, attendee management, check-in apps, handling复杂的 ticketing scenarios. However, always embed the external registration on your site using iframe or button rather than redirecting entirely. Hybrid approach works best: collect basic info on your site, then link to Eventbrite for payment and detailed registration. This captures early interest while leveraging specialized tools."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Mobile optimization is critical - 70%+ of attendees check event websites on phones. Start with mobile-first design: large touch targets (44x44px minimum), simplified navigation, single-column layouts. Critical mobile features: (1) Sticky header with register/ticket button always visible, (2) One-click registration forms (minimize typing), (3) Clickable phone numbers for venue contact, (4) Google Maps integration for directions, (5) Mobile-optimized schedule view, (6) Add to calendar buttons (native mobile calendars), (7) QR code ticket display. Test heavily: load times under 3 seconds, forms work smoothly on mobile, schedule readable without zooming. Common mistakes: tiny text requiring zoom, complex navigation buried under menus, desktop-first layouts that break on mobile, slow loading from unoptimized images. Remember: attendees' first interaction with your event is on mobile."

          "text": "Comprehensive FAQ sections reduce support emails by 60-70%. key FAQ topics: (1) Registration/ticketing - deadline, refund policy, payment methods, group discounts, (2) Venue - parking details, public transit, ride share drop zones, accessibility, (3) Schedule - session timing, simultaneous tracks, meal breaks, (4) Accommodations - recommended hotels, room blocks, travel booking, (5) What to bring - dress code, materials provided, devices needed, (6) Food/drink - dietary accommodations, what's included, alternatives, (7) Contact - who to email for which issues, emergency contacts day-of event. Include venue photos to set expectations. embed Google Maps for directions. Provide downloadable PDFs for offline access. Update FAQ weekly as new questions come in - every email question represents an FAQ addition. Proactive information = reactive support reduced."

          <p class="text-gray-700">Event website timeline: 3-6 months before - launch teaser page with date announcement, email capture for interest list. 2-3 months before - full event website launch, speaker announcements, early bird tickets, registration open. 1-2 months before - detailed agenda published, venue information, travel/accommodation details. 2-4 weeks before - final schedule confirmed, last-minute updates, comprehensive FAQ. Event week - live updates, check-in information, mobile-optimized schedule. For recurring events, keep website live year-round to build SEO and traffic over time.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What features should event websites include?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Event websites need hero section with event name, date, location, clear CTA, registration/RSVP form collecting attendee information, event schedule/agenda with session times, speaker/performer profiles with photos and bios, venue information with address/parking/transit, ticketing or registration payment integration, sponsor showcase section if applicable, FAQ section answering common questions, contact information, social media links, photo gallery from past events for recurring events, and mobile-optimized experience since 70%+ of attendees check on phones.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How do I handle ticketing and payments on event websites?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">For ticketing, you have three main approaches. Integrated solutions like Eventbrite embeds work with all AI builders, provide professional ticketing and handle payments/check-ins, but charge fees (3.5% + $1.79/ticket). Direct payment through Stripe integration via Webflow, Squarespace Commerce has lower fees (2.9% + $0.30) but requires manual attendee management. Hybrid approach uses Eventbrite for initial ticketing then exports attendee list. For free events, use built-in forms. For paid events under 100 attendees, Stripe direct is most cost-effective. For events over 100 attendees, Eventbrite's management features justify the fees.</p>

        <div class="border-l-4 border-sky-500 bg-sky-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should event websites include registration forms or link to external platforms?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Both approaches work depending on event complexity. Simple events like weddings, private parties, workshops should use built-in forms from Mixo, Squarespace, or Webflow - keeps visitors on your site, captures data directly, controls the experience. Complex events like multi-track conferences or festivals with multiple ticket types benefit from external platforms like Eventbrite for specialized features and attendee management. However, always embed the external registration on your site using iframe or button rather than redirecting entirely. Hybrid approach works best: collect basic info on your site, then link to Eventbrite for payment and detailed registration.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How do I optimize event websites for mobile attendees?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Mobile optimization is critical - 70%+ of attendees check event websites on phones. Start with mobile-first design: large touch targets (44x44px minimum), simplified navigation, single-column layouts. Critical mobile features: sticky header with register/ticket button always visible, one-click registration forms minimizing typing, clickable phone numbers for venue contact, Google Maps integration for directions, mobile-optimized schedule view, add to calendar buttons, QR code ticket display. Test heavily: load times under 3 seconds, forms work smoothly on mobile, schedule readable without zooming. Common mistakes: tiny text requiring zoom, complex navigation buried under menus, desktop-first layouts that break on mobile, slow loading from unoptimized images.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What information reduces support questions for events?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Comprehensive FAQ sections reduce support emails by 60-70%. key FAQ topics: registration/ticketing with deadline, refund policy, payment methods, group discounts; venue with parking details, public transit, ride share drop zones, accessibility; schedule with session timing, simultaneous tracks, meal breaks; accommodations with recommended hotels, room blocks, travel booking; what to bring including dress code, materials provided, devices needed; food/drink with dietary accommodations; contact info for different issue types. Include venue photos, embed Google Maps for directions, provide downloadable PDFs for offline access. Update FAQ weekly as new questions come in.</p>

    </span></h2>
    <p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-white/90 font-bold max-w-4xl">
      Event websites serve one purpose: get people to register. Your site must display: event details, date/time, venue location, speaker profiles, schedule, registration pricing, ticket purchasing. Potential attendees fear: wasting money on boring events, unclear logistics, commitment difficulty. Address fears, show value, simplify registration. Social proof (attendee count, testimonials) drives registrations more than descriptions. Make registration effortless: one-click ticket buying, clear pricing tiers, instant confirmation.

        <h4 class="text-3xl font-black mb-4" style="color: #8B5CF6;">EVENT COUNTDOWN TIMERS</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Urgency drives action</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Countdown timers create urgency: "Early bird ends in 3 days," "Only 50 spots left." FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) triggers registration. Static dates ("March 15, 2026") feel distant. Ticking countdowns feel immediate. Urgency = registrations. Without countdowns, visitors procrastinate. With countdowns, visitors register now.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Conference added countdown timer to early bird pricing. Registration rate increased 89% during final 48 hours (last-minute surge). Same event without countdown: registrations trickled in evenly. Countdowns create urgency spikes = revenue spikes.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Star power sells tickets</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Display speakers/performers prominently: photos, names, credentials, session titles. Headline speakers drive registrations. "Learn from industry experts" is weak. "Keynote by John Smith (Google CEO, 20M+ followers)" is strong. Name recognition = registration motivation. Profile quality = perceived event quality.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Tech conference listed speaker companies only ("Speakers from Google, Meta, Amazon"). Added speaker names, photos, credentials. Ticket sales increased 127% (attendees researched speakers, got excited). Specificity = credibility = registrations.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Show event atmosphere</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Photo galleries from previous events prove event quality: crowd energy, venue setup, happy attendees. Stock venue photos underperform. Real past event photos build trust: "This event actually happens, people actually enjoy it." First-time events use venue photos + mockups. Recurring events leverage past success.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Music festival used stock crowd photos. Ticket sales: 40% of target. Switched to real photos from previous year (actual crowd, actual stage, happy faces). Ticket sales: 89% of target (123% increase). Authenticity = trust = registrations.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">List all ticket types with prices: General Admission ($199), VIP ($499), Early Bird ($99). Show what each tier includes: seating, meals, meet-and-greet, recordings. Hidden pricing ("Call for rates") creates anxiety. Transparent pricing builds confidence. Clear value comparison = easier decision = more registrations.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Summit listed "Registration: $299+" only. Added pricing tier comparison table: Basic ($199), Standard ($299), VIP ($499). Each tier's inclusions clearly listed. Registrations increased 67% (clarity overcame hesitation), VIP sales increased 213% (value obvious).</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Native ticket sales, payment processing</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Eventbrite: built-in ticketing, payment processing, check-in apps, attendee management. For events prioritizing ticket sales—Eventbrite provides complete solution. Event website included with ticketing page. Limited customization vs website builders, but ticketing functionality unmatched.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Conference used Eventbrite: ticket page + registration + check-in + email reminders all in one platform. Sold 500 tickets in 2 weeks. Platform fee: 6.5% ($3,250 on $50,000 revenue). Worth it for convenience.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Customizable event websites</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Wix Events templates: event schedules, speaker profiles, countdown timers, ticket integration. For events where brand presentation drives premium ticket pricing—Wix templates justify higher prices. Custom design = perceived event quality.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Luxury gala used Wix: elegant event website, speaker photos, sponsor showcase. VIP tickets ($1,000) sold out in 3 weeks. Presentation justified premium pricing.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">CRM for attendee retention</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Durable includes CRM: capture attendee data, track event attendance, send reminders for next events. For recurring events (annual conferences, monthly workshops)—built-in CRM increases repeat attendance without manual follow-up. Build loyal attendee base automatically.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Workshop series used Durable CRM: tracked 800+ attendees across 12 events, sent personalized invites to new events. Repeat attendance increased 67%, revenue per attendee increased 40%.</p>

      <div class="bg-gray-50 p-8 border-[3px]" style="border-color: #94A3B8;">

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Launch event page immediately</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Mixo AI: generate event website in 30 seconds: date, location, speakers, ticket link. For events needing immediate presence—Mixo delivers instantly. Customize later with photos, schedule. Speed advantage: start selling tickets same-day vs weeks building custom site.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Speaker announced event, needed ticket page immediately. Mixo: launched in 30 minutes + 30 minutes customization = 1 hour total. Sold $5,000 in tickets first day.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700">Event websites should convert 15-25% of visitors into registrants. Track: Registration conversion rate, Ticket tier breakdown (what sells), Abandoned registrations (follow up), Schedule page visits (interest indicator), Speaker profile views (attendance predictor), Sponsor link clicks (deliver value), Add-to-calendar clicks (commitment signal). Event website optimization: Early bird pricing drives urgency, Countdown timers increase conversions 30%, Social proof displays ("500+ attending") build FOMO, Email capture for updates (nurture non-converters), Mobile optimization is critical (60%+ mobile traffic), Fast loading under 2 seconds (attendees are impatient), Clear FAQ reduces support tickets 40%, Weather contingency plans if outdoor, Photo galleries from past events build excitement, Attendee testimonials create social proof, Partner/press logos add credibility.</p>

      <p class="text-2xl font-bold text-center">
        🎉 Brutal truth: Event planners = portfolio business. Clients hire based on photos of past events, design aesthetic, perceived professionalism. AI templates can't compete with custom portfolio design.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-center mt-4 text-gray-700">
        Event planner needs: Photo/video galleries (past events visual proof), booking forms with calendar (lead capture 24/7), service menus + pricing (transparency builds trust), vendor testimonials (social proof), event calendar (showcase availability), blog (event planning tips = SEO traffic, thought leadership).<br/>
        Best platforms: Squarespace 9/10 (event templates, gallery-focused), Webflow 8.5/10 (custom portfolios for premium planners), Wix 8/10 (Wix Events app), WordPress 7.5/10 (flexible but technical).<br/>
        AI builders: 6.5/10 (fast but lack event-specific features like booking calendars, galleries).<br/>
        Verdict: Squarespace = sweet spot for 60% of event planners. Webflow = premium design-focus brands. Wix = users needing Wix Events app features.
