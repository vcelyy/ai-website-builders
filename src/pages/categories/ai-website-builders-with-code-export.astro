              Developer friend spent 6 months building marketing site on Wix. Startup grew, wanted to add custom dashboard, integrate backend. Wix can't do it. Asked to export code. Wix: "No export option." Site is locked into Wix hosting forever. Choice: rebuild from scratch (6 months work lost) or keep paying Wix forever. He chose poorly. This is vendor lock-in, and it's by design.

Builder selection = months of time saved or lost.</p>

Reality: still needs updates, bug fixes, dependency management, hosting maintenance, SSL renewal. Framer handled all this automatically. Self-hosted = more work, not less. Builder hosting = $15/month buys you infrastructure, security, updates, support. Calculate your hourly rate. Is saving $15/month worth 10 hours/month maintenance?</p>

Customizing exported code requires understanding how Webflow works. Might as well keep using Webflow. Unless you're rebuilding from scratch, export doesn't buy you freedom. It just gives you files. The lock-in is in the patterns, not the hosting.</p>

						<strong>Quick reality check:</strong> Code export matters if you're a developer who needs custom features, proprietary hosting, or backend integration. For everyone else, builder hosting is fine. The psychological comfort of "I can leave anytime" is worth something. But 95% of users never exercise that option. Don't overpay for export you'll never use.

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">React export (Framer) vs HTML export (others)</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Framer exports React components. Modern, maintainable, component-based architecture. If you know React, exported code is immediately useful. CodeDesign, Dorik, Webflow export HTML/CSS/JS. Simpler, but less maintainable for complex sites. Choose based on your tech stack. React developer = Framer. Non-developer who wants simple HTML = CodeDesign.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Export quality varies wildly</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Framer: clean, modern React. CodeDesign: semantic HTML, well-organized CSS. Webflow: production-ready but coupled to Webflow patterns. Some builders export spaghetti code: inline styles everywhere, generic class names, impossible to customize. Test export quality before committing. Export a sample page. Read the code. Can you work with this?
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Code export doesn't mean "easy to customize"</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Marketing implies "export code, then do whatever you want." Reality: exported code is tightly coupled to builder's patterns. Customizing requires learning those patterns. Want to add feature builder doesn't support? Either work within builder's constraints or rebuild from scratch. Export gives you files, not freedom. Freedom requires rebuilding.

					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>No export = locked in forever</h2>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Wix, Squarespace, Durable, 10Web: no export option</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					These builders don't allow code export. Ever. Your site lives on their servers or nowhere. This is intentional vendor lock-in. You leave, you lose everything. 6 months of work? Gone. Must rebuild from scratch. They know this. That's why they don't offer export. It keeps you paying forever. For some, this is fine. For developers planning custom features, this is a trap.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">When lock-in is acceptable</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					You're non-technical. You want builder to handle everything. You never need custom features. You don't want to manage hosting. Wix or Squarespace is fine. Pay the monthly fee, forget about infrastructure. Lock-in trades freedom for convenience. For most small businesses, this trade is worth it. Only developers and growing startups hit the limits.
