          <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
          <div class="space-y-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A dental practice needed a website. Services, team profiles, appointment booking form, blog for SEO tips. Same content, three different WordPress approaches.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Traditional WordPress (6 hours):</strong> Bought hosting ($12/month), installed WordPress manually (15 minutes), searched through 10,000+ themes (1 hour), picked a free medical theme, installed plugins (Yoast SEO, Wordfence security, UpdraftPlus backups - 30 minutes), configured settings (1 hour), replaced placeholder content (2 hours), fixed mobile layout issues (45 minutes), tested forms (30 minutes). Result: Professional site. Total time: 6 hours. Monthly cost: $12.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>10Web AI (8 minutes):</strong> Created account, answered 3 questions ("dentist in Chicago", "modern design", "need booking form"), clicked generate. AI built complete site in 47 seconds. Generated blog posts about dental hygiene. Added team profile sections. Changed brand colors in 2 clicks. Connected custom domain (2 minutes). Result: 90% as good as traditional site. Total time: 8 minutes. Monthly cost: $25 (includes hosting).</p>

            <div class="bg-purple-100 border-l-[4px] border-purple-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p class="text-sm text-purple-900 font-medium"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> Traditional WordPress took 6 hours and cost $12/month. 10Web took 8 minutes and cost $25/month. That's $13/month premium to save 5 hours and 52 minutes. If your time is worth more than $2.23/hour, 10Web wins. Even at minimum wage, 10Web saves you money.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>WordPress + AI Plugins (3 hours, $61/month):</strong> Installed WordPress manually (15 minutes), added Elementor for drag-drop editing ($59/year), installed AI writing plugin (Jarvis - $49/month), installed AI image generator (DALL-E plugin - $10/month), generated content with AI, designed pages manually. Result: Good but felt like wrestling two separate tools. AI plugins fought with theme settings. Total time: 3 hours. Monthly cost: $12 (hosting) + $49 (Jarvis) + $10 (images) + $5 (Elementor) = $76/month.</p>

            <div class="bg-violet-100 border-l-[4px] border-violet-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p class="text-sm text-violet-900 font-medium"><strong>The 3-month reality check:</strong> Traditional WordPress site worked fine but client paid developer $150/month for maintenance (updates, security scans, backups). Total monthly cost: $162. 10Web site handles updates automatically. Total cost: $25. WordPress + plugins approach? Client cancelled after 2 months—too complex, plugins conflicted, site broke twice.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The lesson:</strong> 10Web AI is the sweet spot. Fast to launch, managed hosting, fair price. Traditional WordPress only makes sense if you're a developer who enjoys maintenance. WordPress + AI plugins is a trap—more expensive than 10Web, more complex, worse integration.</p>

      </h2>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Speed to launch: 10Web wins</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>10Web AI:</strong> 5-8 minutes from signup to published site. AI generates structure, content, images. You edit text, swap photos, change colors. Done.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Traditional WordPress:</strong> 4-8 hours minimum. Browse themes (1-2 hours), install WordPress (15 minutes), configure plugins (1 hour), add content (2-4 hours), fix issues (1 hour). Faster if you've done it 100 times. Slower if you're learning.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>WordPress + Plugins:</strong> 2-4 hours. Similar to traditional but AI generates content. Still need to design layout, configure theme, fix conflicts. The AI helps but doesn't eliminate work.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Cost: Traditional wins (barely)</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Traditional WordPress:</strong> $4-45/month for hosting. Free themes available. Free plugins available. Total: $4-45/month if you do everything yourself.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>10Web AI:</strong> $10-60/month including hosting. Premium plans start at $25/month. You're paying for convenience and AI generation.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>WordPress + Plugins:</strong> Hosting ($5-50) + AI writing ($20-100) + AI images ($10-30) + premium plugins ($0-50) = $35-230/month. This gets expensive fast.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        For the dental practice site, traditional WordPress cost $12/month but $150/month in developer maintenance. 10Web cost $25/month with zero maintenance. The "cheap" option wasn't actually cheap.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Control and customization: Traditional wins</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Traditional WordPress:</strong> Complete control. Edit any file, install any plugin, modify any theme. Build from scratch if you want. 60,000+ plugins give you infinite flexibility. You're never limited.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>10Web AI:</strong> You get WordPress + Elementor (drag-drop editor). Full control over content and design within Elementor. You can install plugins, edit code, do whatever custom work you want. It's real WordPress, not a limited platform. The only limitation is the AI-generated starting point—but you can customize everything after that.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>WordPress + Plugins:</strong> Same control as traditional. You're using regular WordPress with plugins added. The AI just generates content—you still have full control.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">AI quality: 10Web wins</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>10Web AI:</strong> Generates complete site structure, pages, blog posts. Content is surprisingly good—better than expected. Not GPT-4 quality, but usable. You'll want to edit, but it's 80% there.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Traditional WordPress:</strong> No AI. You write everything yourself or hire a copywriter. Zero automation.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>WordPress + Plugins:</strong> Depends on plugins. Jarvis/Jasper writes good copy. AI SEO plugins help with meta tags. But you're managing multiple tools, none integrated. Quality varies by plugin.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        For the dental practice, 10Web's AI generated 5 blog posts about dental hygiene in 47 seconds. A copywriter would charge $50-100 per post = $250-500 for the same work. The AI posts needed editing (20 minutes each), but that's 2 hours vs. paying $500.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Maintenance: 10Web wins</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>10Web AI:</strong> Managed hosting. Updates happen automatically. Security is handled. Backups are automatic. You never touch server settings. It just works.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Traditional WordPress:</strong> You're responsible for everything. WordPress core updates, theme updates, plugin updates, security scans, backups, server management. If something breaks, you fix it. If you get hacked, it's on you. The dental practice paid $150/month for peace of mind.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>WordPress + Plugins:</strong> Same maintenance burden as traditional. More plugins = more update conflicts = more things breaking. The AI plugins add another layer of complexity.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">E-commerce: All three work</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        All three approaches can run WooCommerce. That's the beauty of WordPress—e-commerce works the same regardless of how you build the site. 10Web, traditional, or plugins—all support WooCommerce equally.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The difference is setup time. 10Web AI can generate a WooCommerce store in minutes. Traditional takes hours. Plugins are somewhere in between.
      </p>

        <ul class="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Developer maintenance:</strong> Most businesses pay someone $50-200/month to handle updates, security, backups. Your "cheap" $12/month hosting becomes $62-212/month.</li>
          <li><strong>Time cost:</strong> If you maintain it yourself, you're spending 2-4 hours/month on updates, troubleshooting, fixing broken plugins. What's your hourly rate?</li>
          <li><strong>Plugin conflicts:</strong> Update a plugin, something breaks. Spend 2 hours fixing. This happens regularly.</li>
          <li><strong>Security anxiety:</strong> Is your site secure? Are backups working? Most WordPress owners don't actually know. They worry about it constantly.</li>

          <li><strong>Subscription bloat:</strong> AI writing ($49/month), AI images ($10/month), premium theme ($59/year), premium plugins ($50-100/year). Adds up to $70-150/month before hosting.</li>
          <li><strong>Integration nightmare:</strong> Plugin A doesn't work with Plugin B. Theme conflicts with AI plugin. You're constantly debugging.</li>
          <li><strong>Cancellation fees:</strong> Try canceling AI subscriptions. Some make it difficult. You keep paying for tools you rarely use.</li>

      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        10Web AI is the future of WordPress. AI generation + managed hosting + full WordPress power. For 95% of users, it's the obvious choice. You get speed, convenience, and all the WordPress flexibility you'll ever need.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Traditional WordPress makes sense for developers and power users who want total control and don't mind maintenance. But be honest about the time cost—6 hours vs. 8 minutes is massive.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        WordPress + AI plugins? Skip it. More expensive than 10Web, more complex, worse integration. The only reason to use this approach is if you have very specific AI needs that 10Web can't handle. That's rare.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The dental practice site? After 3 months, they're still on 10Web. Zero issues, zero maintenance, $25/month. The traditional WordPress quote was $12/month + $150/month maintenance = $162/month. They saved $137/month and saved 6 hours of setup time. That's not a close decision.
