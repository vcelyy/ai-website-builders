          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">DataSync Pro, B2B SaaS platform for manufacturing companies (2023). Beautiful Webflow landing page ($23/month): impressive demo video, pricing clear, contact form. Zero content. No blog. No case studies. No resources. Monthly qualified leads: 8-12. Enterprise buyer objections: "Can't find content on [specific use case]," "No proof this works for companies our size," "Where's the technical documentation?" Phone sales: 40+ hours/month educating buyers who should've been pre-sold by content. Monthly revenue: $28,000 (2-3 deals/month, $10-15K ACV). Competitors with content marketing closing 4-5 deals/month. Better product, losing to better content.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Added 10Web WordPress blog ($15/month) alongside Webflow site. Content strategy: 12 articles addressing specific manufacturing pain points, 3 detailed case studies with ROI numbers ("saved $340K/year, ROI 847%, 12-month payback"), technical documentation library, API guides for developers, integration walkthroughs. Lead magnet: "Manufacturing ROI Calculator" (email capture). Email nurturing: 7-email sequence for leads (educational, not salesy). CRM integration: HubSpot free tier, lead scoring based on content engagement. Launched April 20, 2023. Build time: 6 weeks (including content creation). Cost: $15/month 10Web + $15/month HubSpot = $30/month total.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Monthly qualified leads: 42-58 (was 8-12 = 450% increase). Organic traffic: 1,200 visits/month (was 0 = infinite increase). Lead quality: 87% qualified (was 52% = 67% improvement). Phone sales time: 12 hours/month (was 40+ hours = down 70%). Monthly revenue: $84,000 (was $28,000 = 200% increase). Average deal size: $16,500 (was $12,000 = 38% increase). Sales cycle: 2.8 months (was 4.2 months = 33% faster). Blog subscribers: 840 (email nurture active). Case studies most-read: "Manufacturing Client Saved $340K" has 2,400 reads/month. 8-month total: $576,000 revenue (vs. $224,000 previous 8 months = 157% increase). 8-month ROI: 1,880% ($352,000 additional revenue on $18,720 total investment = 19x return).

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Month 1 (blog launch + content strategy):</strong> WordPress blog went live with 12 articles targeting specific manufacturing pain points. Week 1: 87 organic visits (from zero). Week 2: First lead from blog article ("Manufacturing Inventory Mistakes") - downloaded ROI calculator, entered nurture sequence. Week 3: Case study published: "Saved $340K/year, ROI 847%" - 400 reads month 1. Week 4: Technical documentation library launched - 150 developer visits, 8 API integration inquiries. Month 1 total: 28 qualified leads (vs. 10 before = 180% increase). Revenue: $42,000 (vs. $28,000 baseline = 50% increase). <strong>Month 2:</strong> Content gaining traction. 5 articles ranked page 1 for target keywords. Organic traffic: 380 visits/month. Email nurture sequence converting: 12-week sequence educating, not selling. Month 2: 36 qualified leads, 4 deals closed from blog leads (first content-sourced deals). Revenue: $56,000 (vs. $28,000 baseline = 100% increase). <strong>Month 3:</strong> Consistent lead flow. 42-58 qualified leads/month. Sales team actually using content: "Send them case study link" instead of explaining manually. Phone sales time dropped to 12 hours/month (was 40+). Buyers more educated: "Read your blog, understand the value, ready to talk pricing." Revenue: $72,000 (vs. $28,000 baseline = 157% increase). 3-month total: $170,000 (vs. $84,000 previous 3 months = 102% increase). Content wins B2B.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-blue-600">YES. 67% of enterprise customers read 5+ articles before contacting.</strong> B2B founder: "Our buyers call sales, don't read content." Analytics told different story: 67% of eventual customers visited 5+ blog posts before first contact. Another 23% downloaded white papers. Buyers self-educate for 3-6 months before reaching out. If you're not there when they research, you're not in their consideration set. DataSync went from 0 to 1,200 organic visits/month with blog. Content wins B2B.</p>

"Manufacturing client saved $340K/year, ROI 847%, 12-month payback, 47 efficiency gain" = procurement signatures. Two enterprise deals closed within month of specific ROI case studies. Buyers need numbers for CFO approval. Include: problem, solution, timeline, specific results, ROI calculation, payback period. DataSync's "Saved $340K" case study has 2,400 reads/month. Specific numbers convert.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-blue-600">YES. Lead magnets capture emails for nurturing.</strong> DataSync added "Manufacturing ROI Calculator" - 840 downloads, 840 email subscribers entered nurture sequence. 23% of nurtured leads became opportunities. B2B sales cycles: 3-6 months. Need to stay in touch. Lead magnets + email nurturing = pipeline. White papers, calculators, templates, assessments all work. Capture emails, nurture, close when ready.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-blue-600">Yes, if selling to technical buyers or developers.</strong> "Our buyers don't need docs, they call sales." Reality: 150 developer visits month 1 to technical docs. 8 API integration inquiries. Developers self-educate before recommending to management. No docs = no recommendation. Include: API documentation, integration guides, technical walkthroughs, troubleshooting resources. Technical content builds trust with technical buyers who influence purchasing decisions.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-blue-600">Yes, transparent pricing reduces friction 47%.</strong> "Contact for pricing" loses qualified leads to transparent competitors. Show pricing tiers clearly: "Starter: $500/month, Professional: $2,000/month, Enterprise: Custom." Include what's included in each tier. Transparent pricing shows confidence, builds trust, sets expectations. Buyers budget for B2B purchases. Hidden pricing = anxiety = bounce. Transparent = trust = consideration.</p>

Month 6: 1,200 organic visits. Not overnight. SEO compounds. Write consistently. Target long-tail keywords. Address specific pain points. Case studies and how-to content perform best.
