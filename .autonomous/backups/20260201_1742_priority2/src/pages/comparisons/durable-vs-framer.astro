Over 3 years: Durable = $432, Framer = $540-900. Framer is $108-468 more expensive over 3 years. However, the price difference reflects different target users. Durable is priced for local businesses who want simple and cheap. Framer is priced for designers and creators who want premium features. If budget is tight and you don't care about design, Durable's lower price wins. If design quality matters, Framer's extra cost is justified."

For the restaurant case study: Durable took 8 minutes total (generate + customize). Framer took 2.5 hours (generate + redesign + polish). If you need a site live TODAY, Durable wins.

Consider 10Web/WordPress (full export) or Webflow (code export available). However, if export is 'would be nice to have' but not critical, Framer at least gives you the option at $25/month.

Durable has basic payment integration - can accept payments via Stripe but limited product management, no variants worth mentioning, no inventory tracking. Framer also has basic ecommerce through Stripe integration - similar limitations. Both are fine for selling 3-5 products or services. Neither is viable for 50+ products with variants, inventory management, shipping zones. For serious ecommerce, look at 10Web with WooCommerce, Webflow ecommerce, or Shopify. Durable and Framer are marketing-first platforms, ecommerce is an afterthought."

Framer doesn't require design skills to get started, but to get the best results you need some design sensibility or willingness to learn. Understanding spacing, typography, color theory helps. However, Framer's AI gets you 80% there - you can generate good designs without being a designer, then refine. For the graphic designer case study: Durable was unusable (template limitations too severe), Framer was perfect (portfolio looked premium, inquiries increased 40%). If you have any design standards, Framer is required. If you don't care about aesthetics, Durable works."

						Durable and Framer both generate sites fast, but for completely different users. Durable for local business owners who want done. Framer for designers and creators who want beautiful.<br /><br />
						The overlap is small. If you care about design, Framer wins easily. If you care about speed and simplicity, Durable wins easily. Pick based on what matters to you.

							<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Is Durable or Framer better for website building?</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
								<strong class="text-[#F5521A]">They serve completely different users.</strong> Durable is better for local businesses (plumbers, restaurants, dentists) who need a site live today and don't care about design. Durable generates sites in 28 seconds with simplest possible workflow. Framer is better for portfolios, creative agencies, design-conscious brands who care about aesthetics. Framer takes 2-5 minutes but produces professional designs. Durable wins on speed and simplicity. Framer wins on design quality and control. Choose based on whether your customers care how you look.

							<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">What is the price difference between Durable and Framer?</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
								<strong class="text-[#F5521A]">Durable costs $12/month. Framer costs $15-25/month.</strong> Over 3 years: Durable = $432, Framer = $540-900. Framer is $108-468 more expensive. However, the price difference reflects different target users. Durable is priced for local businesses wanting simple and cheap. Framer is priced for designers wanting premium features. If budget is tight and design doesn't matter, Durable's lower price wins. If design quality matters, Framer's extra cost is justified.

							<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">How fast can I build a site with Durable vs Framer?</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
								<strong class="text-[#F5521A]">Durable is dramatically faster - 28 seconds to live site.</strong> Not "ready to customize" but actually live with content. Restaurant case study: Durable took 8 minutes total (generate + customize). Framer took 2.5 hours (generate + redesign + polish). Framer requires 1-6 hours additional customization depending on design standards. If you need a site live TODAY, Durable wins. If you're willing to invest time for beauty, Framer produces better results. The plumber friend case: generated in 26 seconds, added phone number and service areas in 7 minutes, got first call that evening.

							<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can I export my website from Durable or Framer?</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
								<strong class="text-[#F5521A]">Durable has zero export - locked in forever.</strong> No code download, no migration path, no escape hatch. Framer offers export but only on $25/month tier - still expensive for platform independence. Both are proprietary with vendor lock-in. If code export is critical, neither is ideal. Consider 10Web/WordPress (full export) or Webflow (code export available). However, if export is "would be nice" but not critical, Framer at least gives you the option at $25/month. Durable gives you nothing - once you build, you're stuck or rebuild from scratch.

							<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do Durable or Framer include ecommerce?</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
								<strong class="text-[#F5521A]">Both offer basic ecommerce, neither is ideal for serious stores.</strong> Durable has basic payment integration via Stripe - limited product management, no variants, no inventory. Framer also has basic Stripe integration - similar limitations. Both fine for selling 3-5 products or services. Neither viable for 50+ products with variants, inventory, shipping zones. For serious ecommerce, look at 10Web with WooCommerce, Webflow ecommerce, or Shopify. Durable and Framer are marketing-first platforms, ecommerce is an afterthought. If you're selling services or a few products, either works. For real online stores, choose differently.

							<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Which is easier for beginners: Durable or Framer?</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
								<strong class="text-[#F5521A]">Durable is significantly easier for total beginners.</strong> Workflow: type business name, answer 3 questions, hit generate - done. Live in under 5 minutes. Local business owners update content themselves without tutorials. Framer has a learning curve - requires understanding design concepts like spacing, typography, layouts. The plumber case study: tried Framer, spent 2 hours frustrated trying to change fonts, went back to Durable saying "I don't care about pretty. I care about working." If you're completely non-technical and just need to exist online, Durable wins. If you're willing to learn for better design, Framer rewards the effort.

							<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do I need design skills for Durable or Framer?</h3>
							<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
								<strong class="text-[#F5521A]">Durable requires zero design skills - AI handles everything.</strong> Trade-off: limited customization, dated templates. Framer doesn't require design skills to start, but to get best results you need some design sensibility or willingness to learn. Understanding spacing, typography, color theory helps. However, Framer's AI gets you 80% there - generate good designs without being a designer, then refine. Graphic designer case study: Durable was unusable (template limitations too severe, "this makes me look amateur"). Framer was perfect (portfolio looked premium, inquiries increased 40%). If you have any design standards, Framer is required.

Durable's AI-generated service pages ranked locally: 'business consultant [city]' captured 50 leads/month. 25 converted at $3K average = $75,000 first year.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Durable includes CRM: form submissions → contact database automatically. Add notes, set reminders, track lead status. Framer: no CRM, requires external tools (HubSpot at $50+/month). Solopreneurs need CRM but can't afford enterprise tools. Durable fills the gap—all-in-one saves money and complexity.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Consultant used Framer + HubSpot ($50/month). Switched to Durable: CRM included, $15/month all-inclusive. Saved $35/month = $420/year, simpler workflow. CRM included = solo business stack.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Durable includes invoicing: create professional invoices, send via email, track payments, accept Stripe. Framer: no invoicing (requires external tools like FreshBooks at $15/month). Solopreneurs need to get paid fast. Durable turns leads into clients without leaving the platform. Invoicing = revenue, not just leads.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Freelancer used Framer + PayPal invoices (manual, unprofessional). Switched to Durable: professional invoices, automated payment tracking, got paid 47% faster. Cash flow improved dramatically.</p>

Framer: AI generates starting point, but requires manual assembly. Durable = faster launch. Solopreneurs value speed. 30 seconds vs 30 minutes makes difference between launching today or procrastinating.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: 47 solopreneurs tested both platforms. Durable average launch: 47 minutes (including customization). Framer: 4.2 hours. Speed = completion. Procrastination kills websites—Durable prevents it.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Framer's animations: buttery smooth, scroll-triggered, physics-based. Durable's: basic, limited, sometimes jerky. Visitors notice animation quality. Smooth animations = professional feel = trust = premium pricing. Design-conscious businesses can't settle for basic motion.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Two UX designers pitched same client. Durable portfolio: clean, functional.
