        Medical websites serve different purposes than general business sites:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Patient trust signals</strong> - Certifications, affiliations, insurance accepted</li>
        <li><strong>Appointment booking</strong> - Easy scheduling without phone calls</li>
        <li><strong>Doctor/staff profiles</strong> - Credentials, specialties, photos</li>
        <li><strong>Service information</strong> - Treatments, procedures, what to expect</li>
        <li><strong>Patient resources</strong> - Forms, insurance info, FAQ</li>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Durable AI: Fastest Setup</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Generated a complete medical practice site in 45 seconds. Included pre-built sections for services, doctors, and contact. The appointment booking form was basic but functional.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Solo practitioners, small clinics, therapists who need a site fast.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">10Web: Content-Heavy Medical Sites</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Built a WordPress site with health blog, patient education library, and service pages. WordPress has thousands of medical themes and HIPAA-friendly plugins available.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Practices doing content marketing, health education, medical blogs.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">Framer: Design-Focused Practices</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Created a beautiful, modern medical site with excellent visuals. Best for specialists where aesthetics matter (cosmetic surgery, dermatology, dental).

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">HIPAA Considerations</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <strong>Important:</strong> AI website builders themselves are not HIPAA-compliant by default. For true HIPAA compliance, you need:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li>BAA (Business Associate Agreement) with your hosting provider</li>
        <li>Encrypted data transmission (SSL)</li>
        <li>Secure appointment booking systems</li>
        <li>Patient data stored in HIPAA-compliant systems</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
        Most AI builders (including Durable, Framer, Wix) can host the front-end of your medical site. But for actual patient data (appointments, records), use specialized healthcare software.

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I use AI builders for HIPAA-compliant medical sites?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">You can use AI builders for the public-facing parts of your medical site (services, doctor profiles, general info). For patient data storage, booking systems, and any PHI (protected health information), you need HIPAA-compliant third-party tools integrated with your site.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Which AI builder is best for solo doctors?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Durable AI is ideal for solo practitioners. You can have a complete site with appointment booking in under 5 minutes total investment. The built-in CRM helps track patient follow-ups.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What about medical content and health blogs?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">10Web with WordPress is best here. WordPress powers 40% of medical websites and has excellent health-focused themes, HIPAA-friendly plugins, and SEO tools for medical content.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I show insurance information on these sites?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, all major AI builders allow you to add custom content including insurance panels accepted, payment information, and patient forms. Durable and 10Web both have pre-built sections for this.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What about telemedicine integration?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">You'll need to embed third-party telemedicine tools (Zoom for Healthcare, Doxy.me, etc.) into your site. All major builders allow embedding iframes and custom code for this purpose.</p>
