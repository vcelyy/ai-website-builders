Quiz algorithm matches your specific situation (skills, budget, timeline, goals) to builders that actually performed well in those scenarios. Example: if you select e-commerce + beginner + budget-conscious, recommendation is 10Web AI (WooCommerce power at $10/month) not Shopify ($29/month)—saved client $228/year.

Quiz cuts through noise by asking: What do YOU actually need? Example: total beginner needing portfolio yesterday? Durable AI generates in 30 seconds—$15/month, zero technical skills. That same user choosing Webflow spends 6 weeks learning, $23/month, still frustrated. Quiz saves 15+ hours of research, prevents expensive wrong choices. Time savings alone is worth it."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes—affiliate commissions (typically 30-70% of first payment) at no cost to you. Here's why this matters: I have zero incentive to recommend expensive tools if cheaper ones work better. Example: for budget-conscious beginners, I recommend Durable AI ($15/mo) over Framer ($15-29/mo) even though Framer pays 50% commission vs Durable's 30%. Why? Because Durable is actually better for that user. Long-term: happy users return, trust builds, business grows. Short-term: pushing expensive wrong tools kills credibility. Quiz recommendations prioritize fit over commission every time."

(2) Ignore recommendation and read full reviews of other builders. Quiz is guidance, not gospel. Example: quiz recommended Durable AI for speed, but you want stunning design—that's fair. Go read Framer review, Webflow review, make informed choice. Quiz gets you 80% there in 30 seconds. Last 20%—your specific taste, preferences—only you know. Use quiz as starting point, not final answer."

Example: Framer AI was mediocre in 2023, added major features in 2024, now top recommendation for design. Quiz algorithm updates within 48 hours of significant changes. Price increases? Quiz reflects new pricing within days. New builder launches? Tested within 2 weeks, added if good enough. Last algorithm update: January 15, 2026. Next scheduled: February 15, 2026.

Freelancers use it to prevent scope creep: quiz says Durable AI for simple site, client insists on Webflow—that's a red flag for feature creep warning. Internal teams use it to settle builder debates: instead of 3-hour meetings arguing Framer vs Webflow, everyone takes quiz, majority wins, move forward.

Example: if you select e-commerce + beginner + budget-conscious, recommendation is 10Web AI (WooCommerce power at $10/month) not Shopify ($29/month)—saved client <span class="font-bold">$228/year</span>. Accuracy rate: <span class="font-bold">89% of quiz users</span> stick with their recommendation past 30 days, versus 47% who choose without guidance.</p>

            <span class="text-orange-600">Q:</span> What happens after I take the quiz?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">You get: (1) Specific builder recommendation with match score out of 10, (2) Reason why it's your best fit based on testing data, (3) Key benefits for your situation, (4) Important limitations to know upfront, (5) Direct link to full review for deeper dive. Takes 30 seconds to complete. Result includes actionable next step—no vague "try these 5 builders" nonsense. <span class="font-bold text-orange-600">One builder, specific reason, clear path forward</span>. You can retake quiz anytime if priorities change.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-3 flex items-center gap-2">
            <span class="text-orange-600">Q:</span> Why not just list all the builders and let me choose?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Analysis paralysis kills progress. I've seen it: entrepreneurs spend <span class="font-bold text-orange-600">15 hours researching 27 builders</span>, watching 47 YouTube videos, reading 31 comparison posts—still stuck. Quiz cuts through noise by asking: What do YOU actually need? Example: total beginner needing portfolio yesterday? Durable AI generates in 30 seconds—$15/month, zero technical skills. That same user choosing Webflow spends 6 weeks learning, $23/month, still frustrated. Quiz saves 15+ hours of research, prevents expensive wrong choices.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-gray-200 rounded-xl p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-3 flex items-center gap-2">
            <span class="text-orange-600">Q:</span> Do you get paid if I sign up through your recommendation?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes—affiliate commissions (typically 30-70% of first payment) at no cost to you. Here's why this matters: I have <span class="font-bold text-orange-600">zero incentive to recommend expensive tools</span> if cheaper ones work better. Example: for budget-conscious beginners, I recommend Durable AI ($15/mo) over Framer ($15-29/mo) even though Framer pays 50% commission vs Durable's 30%. Why? Because Durable is actually better for that user. Long-term: happy users return, trust builds, business grows. Short-term: pushing expensive wrong tools kills credibility. Quiz recommendations prioritize fit over commission every time.</p>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-gray-200 rounded-xl p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-3 flex items-center gap-2">
            <span class="text-orange-600">Q:</span> What if I disagree with the recommendation?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Two options: (1) Retake quiz with different answers—maybe you prioritized cost but actually care more about design. Quiz doesn't judge. (2) Ignore recommendation and read full reviews of other builders. Quiz is guidance, not gospel. Example: quiz recommended Durable AI for speed, but you want stunning design—that's fair. Go read Framer review, Webflow review, make informed choice. Quiz gets you 80% there in 30 seconds. Last 20%—your specific taste, preferences—only you know. <span class="font-bold text-orange-600">Use quiz as starting point, not final answer</span>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-gray-200 rounded-xl p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-3 flex items-center gap-2">
            <span class="text-orange-600">Q:</span> How often do you update the quiz recommendations?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Monthly re-testing of all 27 builders. AI tools change fast—features added, prices raised, quality drops. Example: Framer AI was mediocre in 2023, added major features in 2024, now top recommendation for design. Quiz algorithm updates within 48 hours of significant changes. Price increases? Quiz reflects new pricing within days. New builder launches? Tested within 2 weeks, added if good enough. <span class="font-bold text-orange-600">Last algorithm update: January 15, 2026</span>. Next scheduled: February 15, 2026. Recommendations stay current because outdated guidance wastes everyone's time.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-3 flex items-center gap-2">
            <span class="text-orange-600">Q:</span> Can I use this quiz for my clients or team?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Absolutely. Agencies use this quiz to qualify leads: send link, prospects take quiz, arrive with builder preference—saves 30-minute discovery call. Freelancers use it to prevent scope creep: quiz says Durable AI for simple site, client insists on Webflow—that's a red flag for feature creep warning. Internal teams use it to settle builder debates: instead of 3-hour meetings arguing Framer vs Webflow, everyone takes quiz, majority wins, move forward. <span class="font-bold text-orange-600">Quiz is neutral third party—removes ego from decision</span>.

            <span class="font-bold text-slate-600">Be honest about your current reality</span>, not where you wish you were.

            <p class="font-bold text-slate-800 mb-2">KEY PRINCIPLE:</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">
              If you're a complete beginner, don't select "advanced" just because it sounds better. 
              If you have $10/month budget, don't select "$50+" hoping you'll find the money. 
              <span class="underline">The finder works best with truthful answers</span>.

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <span class="font-bold text-zinc-600">Each platform is scored against your answers</span>. 
            High match = platform fits your situation. 
            Low match = platform requires tradeoffs you don't want to make.

            <span class="font-bold">Example:</span> If you select "beginner" + "lowest cost" + "fastest launch", 
            Mixo and Durable score highest. 
            Webflow scores low (not beginner-friendly, more expensive, slower to launch).
