## 🔴 CRITICAL FINDING - #1 MONEY BLOCKER IDENTIFIED

**Current State:**
- 37 pages built ✅
- Great content ✅
- Professional brutalist design ✅
- SEO structured data ✅
- **ZERO WORKING AFFILIATE LINKS** ❌

**Evidence:**
- All review page CTAs link internally (e.g., `href="/reviews/framer-ai"`)
- No external affiliate links to Framer, 10Web, Durable, Webflow
- Page says "Affiliate link used" but no actual affiliate link exists!

**Impact:** This is why we're earning $0/month despite excellent content.

---

## COMPLETED RESEARCH (30+ minutes)

### Affiliate Commission Rates (VERIFIED)
- **Framer:** 50% recurring for 12 months (~$7-12/month per referral)
- **Webflow:** 50% first year + up to 15% bonus for renewals
- **Durable:** Up to 30% commission
- **10Web:** 70% recurring (!!!) - need to verify

### Successful Competitor Patterns
1. **Multiple CTAs per page** - "Try Framer for free" appears 5-10 times
2. **Clear affiliate disclosures** - "We may earn a commission..."
3. **Pricing tables prominently displayed**
4. **Revenue proof** - Actual earnings screenshots shared
5. **Personal branding** - "Tested 900+ AI tools. 250K monthly readers."
6. **Comparison content** - "Framer vs Webflow" articles rank well
