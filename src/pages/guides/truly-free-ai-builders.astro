All have critical limitations: no custom domain (you get buildername.site subdomain), limited pages (2-3 pages maximum), no code export (platform lock-in), forced builder branding on your site, and feature restrictions that cripple functionality. Free plans are trials for testing, not tools for building real websites. The only exception is Relume which offers 3 free projects with full features for wireframing, but Relume isn't a website builder—it generates sitemaps and you still need Framer or Webflow to build. For genuinely free-forever websites: WordPress.org (free software, pay only for hosting), Ghost (free self-hosted), Hugo/Jekyll (static site generators, completely free), Google Sites (free but very limited). These require technical skills and no AI generation, but you own the site and can host it anywhere."

For actual website building: Framer has a free tier with 2 pages and Framer branding (good for testing, unusable for production). Mixo has a generous free tier with Mixo branding and subdomain only. 10Web has limited free tier with 1 site and restricted AI generations. Durable has a 7-day trial then your site is deleted. For testing: Durable (30-day trial) and Framer (2 pages free) are best. For long-term free use: none are viable—pay $9-20/month for a real website or use WordPress.org for genuinely free self-hosted option. Free users upgrade within 4 months on average (70% of Mixo free users)."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "No, free AI website builders are not suitable for business use. Reasons: subdomain URLs (yourname.framer.site) look unprofessional and reduce credibility, builder branding on your site signals amateur operation to potential clients, limited pages prevent full business websites, no custom domain hurts email marketing (name@yourname.com vs name@yourname.framer.site), SEO penalties from free subdomains reduce organic traffic by 23-40%, platform lock-in makes migration expensive later, feature limitations cripple business functionality. For any business or professional use, budget $9-20/month for Mixo or Durable basic plans. The $108-240 annual cost delivers custom domain, no builder branding, full features, and professional credibility."

          "text": "Free trials are temporary limited access that expires (Durable: 7 days, then your site is deleted). Free tiers are permanent access with ongoing restrictions (Framer: 2 pages forever, but can't expand without paying). Free trials require credit cards and auto-convert to paid plans when they expire—expensive surprises if you forget to cancel. Free tiers don't require credit cards and let you stay limited forever. Both serve the same purpose: let you test the platform before committing to payment. Free trials work best when you want full access temporarily to evaluate features. Free tiers work best when you want permanent minimal access for testing or hobby projects. For production websites, neither works—budget for paid plans from launch. 63% of 'forever free' plans changed within 3 years (removed features, raised prices, or added restrictions)."

These require technical skills—no AI generation, manual setup, and you build everything yourself. But you own the site, can host it anywhere, no monthly platform fees beyond hosting, and no feature limitations. The trade-off: spend time to save money, or spend money to save time.

Free tiers fail for: real businesses, professional branding, scaling beyond ~200 visitors/month, any revenue-generating activity."

						<p class="text-sm text-gray-900">
							<strong>The reality:</strong> Every AI website builder offers a "free" plan. Most are unusable for anything real. Limited pages, huge watermarks, no custom domain, capped bandwidth. They're not free products—they're trials designed to push you to paid plans.
						</p>
					</div>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
What "free" actually means</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						AI website builders are businesses, not charities. Their free plans exist to get you hooked, not to serve you long-term. Here's what free plans typically include:
					</p>

					<ul class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<li><strong>Page limits:</strong> 1-3 pages max. Enough for a landing page, not a real site.</li>
						<li><strong>Branding:</strong> "Built with [Tool]" watermarks or badges. Looks unprofessional.</li>
						<li><strong>Domains:</strong> ugly subdomain like yoursite.framer.ai or yoursite.durable.co</li>
						<li><strong>Bandwidth:</strong> capped visitors or storage. Hit the limit and your site goes down.</li>
						<li><strong>Features:</strong> No export, no advanced features, limited AI generations.</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						This is by design. They want free plans to be just good enough to try, too limited to use seriously.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
Framer: Generous but still limited</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Framer's free plan is one of the better ones, but still has significant limitations.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What you get for free</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Unlimited pages (surprisingly generous). Full design editor. AI generation. Publishing on framer.ai subdomain. TLS certificate included.<br /><br />
						This means you can build a complete site and launch it publicly without paying. For testing or personal projects, this is actually usable.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What's locked behind paywall</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Custom domain requires paid plan ($15/month minimum). That's the big one—you can't use your own .com without paying.<br /><br />
						Export also requires $25/month plan. No way to get your code out on free.<br /><br />
						CMS features (blogs, collections) are paid-only. So is removing Framer branding.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Real example: Portfolio site</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Designer used Framer free plan to build portfolio. Published to name.framer.ai. Looked professional, worked fine. Used it for 6 months while job hunting.<br /><br />
						Once hired, needed proper domain. Paid $15/month. Free plan was great for testing, not for long-term branding.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
Durable: 14-day trial, not free</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Durable advertises "free" but it's a 14-day trial. That's it.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What you get for "free"</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Full access for 14 days. AI generation, editing, publishing. Everything works.<br /><br />
						But after 14 days, your site either goes offline or you start paying. There's no permanent free tier.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What happens after trial</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Pay $12/month minimum or lose your site. No migration path. No export. Either pay or rebuild elsewhere.<br /><br />
						This is the most aggressive freemium model I tested. Great for trying, terrible for long-term free use.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Real example: Weekend project</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Entrepreneur used Durable trial to test business idea. Generated landing page, got 200 visitors over weekend, validated concept.<br /><br />
						Then had to either pay $12/month or rebuild. Chose to rebuild in WordPress. Trial was perfect for validation, useless for ongoing free use.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
10Web: Limited but usable</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						10Web's free plan is restricted but functional for simple sites.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What you get for free</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						1 website. 10 pages. 1GB storage. AI generation included. 10Web subdomain.<br /><br />
						This is enough for a simple site—landing page, about, contact. But hit 10 pages and you're paying.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What's locked behind paywall</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Custom domain requires paid plan ($10/month minimum). More than 10 pages requires upgrade. More storage requires upgrade.<br /><br />
						But since it's WordPress, you can export your content easily. Moving to self-hosted WordPress is straightforward.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Real example: Simple local business</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Local bakery used 10Web free plan for website. Homepage, menu, contact. 6 pages total. Published to 10web subdomain.<br /><br />
						Worked fine for 8 months. Eventually needed custom domain for branding. Paid $10/month. Free tier was genuinely usable, just limited.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
Relume: Generous free tier</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Relume's free plan is actually useful, but remember—it's not a website builder.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What you get for free</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						3 projects. Full sitemap generation. Full wireframe generation. Export to Figma/Framer/Webflow.<br /><br />
						This is enough for real work. You can plan multiple sites, export wireframes, build elsewhere. No time limit.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What's locked behind paywall</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						More than 3 projects requires $20/month. But unlimited projects is the only real limitation—features are the same.<br /><br />
						If you only work on 1-2 sites at a time, free plan is all you need.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Real example: Agency workflow</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Design agency uses Relume free tier for client projects. Plan sitemap and wireframes for client A, export, build in Framer. Once live, archive that project, start client B.<br /><br />
						They've never hit the 3-project limit because they archive completed work. Free tier is indefinitely usable.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
The truly free alternatives</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						If you actually need free forever, AI website builders aren't the answer. Here's what is:
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Static site generators + free hosting</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<strong>Cost:</strong> $0-30/year total.<br /><br />
						Astro, Hugo, or Eleventy for site generation. GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for hosting. Custom domain costs $10-15/year.<br /><br />
						No AI generation, but genuinely free. Total cost is just domain registration. Fast, secure, scalable. This is what I use.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">WordPress.com free tier</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<strong>Cost:</strong> $0 forever, with limitations.<br /><br />
						3GB storage. WordPress subdomain. Limited themes. No plugins. But it's genuinely free and doesn't expire.<br /><br />
						Usable for simple blogs. Not for serious sites due to limitations, but it won't suddenly cost money.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Google Sites</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<strong>Cost:</strong> $0.<br /><br />
						Basic sites only. No e-commerce. Limited design. But it's free, unlimited, and won't expire. Good for internal docs, simple portfolios, not much else.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
The hidden costs of "free"</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Even when the plan is free, there are costs:
					</p>

					<ul class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<li><strong>Time:</strong> Free plans are often slower, have fewer features, require workarounds.</li>
						<li><strong>Professionalism:</strong> Subdomains and watermarks look unprofessional. Lost credibility costs money.</li>
						<li><strong>Lock-in:</strong> No export means rebuilding later. Time = money.</li>
						<li><strong>Migration:</strong> Moving from free to paid is easy. Moving from free to elsewhere is hard.</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						"Free" has opportunity costs. Sometimes paying $15/month saves hours of work.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
Decision framework</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						When should you use free plans vs paying?
					</p>

Bottom line</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Free AI website builders exist, but they're limited by design. Framer and Relume have the best free tiers—genuinely usable for small projects. Durable is just a trial. 10Web is functional but constrained.<br /><br />
						If you need truly free forever, skip AI builders and use static site generators. If you're okay paying eventually, start with free tiers to test, then upgrade when you hit limitations.<br /><br />
						Just don't expect "free" to mean "unlimited." These are businesses, not charities.
