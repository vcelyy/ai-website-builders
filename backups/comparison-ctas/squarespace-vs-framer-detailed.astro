          "text": "Framer wins overall (9.0/10 vs 8.3/10) with superior design quality (9.5/10 vs 8.5/10), better flexibility (9.0/10 vs 7.0/10), code export capability, and more affordable pricing starting at $5/month vs $23/month. Squarespace offers easier usability (8.5/10 vs 8.0/10), more mature platform with established reliability, all-in-one features without need for integrations, and consistently polished templates. Squarespace is better for: users wanting polished results with minimal effort, small businesses needing reliability, e-commerce with built-in features, and those preferring established platforms. Framer is better for: designers wanting maximum visual quality, modern tech companies and startups, those who may want code export, and users prioritizing design aesthetics. Choose Squarespace for easy, polished, reliable websites. Choose Framer for stunning modern designs with more flexibility."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Framer and Squarespace have significantly different pricing structures with Framer being much more affordable. Framer starts at $5/month for personal sites, $15/month for pro features, up to $30/month for advanced plans. Over 3 years, Framer costs $180-1080 depending on plan level. Squarespace starts at $23/month for personal websites, $33/month for business plans, up to $65/month for commerce features. Over 3 years, Squarespace costs $828-2340 depending on plan level. For all website types, Framer is more affordable ($5 vs $23/month base pricing, nearly 5x cheaper at entry level). Framer's aggressive pricing, combined with superior design quality, makes it exceptional value. Squarespace's higher pricing reflects its maturity, all-in-one features, and established brand - worth it for users prioritizing reliability and ease over design. For most users, Framer provides better value with stunning designs at a fraction of the cost."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Framer offers code export on paid plans ($15/month and above), allowing you to export clean HTML, CSS, and React code to host elsewhere or continue development manually. Squarespace does NOT offer code export - your website stays on Squarespace's servers permanently and you're locked into their platform. This is a major difference if you care about owning your code or having flexibility to migrate platforms. With Framer, you can export your code and move to custom development or React hosting when ready. With Squarespace, you're committed to their platform but get an easier experience with mature features and reliability. If code export matters for your long-term strategy, Framer is the clear winner. If you don't care about code export and want the easiest polished experience, Squarespace is the better choice. Platform lock-in is the trade-off for Squarespace's convenience and maturity."

          "text": "Framer has superior AI capabilities with instant site generation from prompts, AI-powered design suggestions, and smart content creation. Its AI generates modern layouts that feel custom rather than template-based. Squarespace's AI is more limited - mainly suggesting templates and basic content suggestions. Framer's AI creates complete sites in seconds with contemporary design aesthetics. Squarespace's AI helps you pick templates but doesn't generate custom designs. For users prioritizing AI-powered site creation, Framer is clearly ahead with more sophisticated AI that produces better-looking results faster."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Squarespace is better for e-commerce with built-in inventory management, payment processing, shipping tools, and order management included. It's designed for online stores with mature e-commerce features. Framer has basic e-commerce through integrations like Stripe and Snipcart but lacks native e-commerce functionality. For serious online stores with products, inventory, and transactions, Squarespace is the better choice with its all-in-one e-commerce platform. Framer can work for simple digital products or basic sales but requires third-party tools. Choose Squarespace for full-featured e-commerce. Choose Framer for marketing sites with basic sales needs."

          "text": "Squarespace is easier for complete beginners with its polished templates, guided setup process, and intuitive drag-and-drop editor. Everything works predictably with minimal learning curve. Framer is also beginner-friendly but has more options and flexibility which can be overwhelming initially. Framer's AI helps beginners get started fast by generating complete sites. For non-technical users who want zero learning curve, Squarespace wins. For beginners willing to spend 30 minutes learning, Framer provides better results. Both are accessible, but Squarespace is more immediately user-friendly while Framer rewards slightly more learning with significantly better designs."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Switching from Squarespace to Framer is possible but requires manual rebuilding - you can't export your site from Squarespace. You'll need to recreate content and design in Framer. Switching from Framer to Squarespace also requires manual rebuilding since Squarespace has different template structure. Neither platform offers direct migration tools. If you're early in the build process, switching is manageable. If you have an established site, switching is significant work. The good news: both platforms make building fast with AI and templates. The best approach is to choose carefully upfront using this comparison. Framer users can export code if they want to leave entirely. Squarespace users are locked in unless they rebuild elsewhere."

        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A freelance designer was competing for a tech startup's website project. Budget: $3,000. Timeline: 2 weeks. Three designers pitching.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Designer A (Squarespace route):</strong> Used Squarespace templates. Site looked professional but "template-y." Client: "This is nice but feels like every other Squarespace site." Bid: $3,000.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Designer B (Webflow route):</strong> Built from scratch. Site was stunning - custom animations, unique interactions. Bid: $6,000 (needed more time for custom work).</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Designer C (Framer route):</strong> Generated base site in 2 minutes with AI. Customized colors, typography, added client's branding. Spent 12 hours total. Site looked like custom design. Bid: $3,000.</p>

          <div class="bg-stone-100 border-l-[4px] border-stone-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-stone-900 font-medium"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> Client hired Designer C (Framer). Why? "It looks custom but costs $3,000. Webflow looks amazing but $6,000 is over budget. Squarespace looks too template-y."</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-slate-100 border-l-[4px] border-slate-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-slate-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Squarespace = reliable but recognizable. Everyone knows a Squarespace site when they see one. Framer = modern aesthetic that looks custom at 1/5 the price of custom Webflow work.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The framework:</strong> For restaurants, portfolios, local businesses where "professional and polished" is enough, Squarespace wins. For tech startups, design agencies, modern brands where "cutting-edge and custom" is the goal, Framer wins every time.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Is Squarespace or Framer better for website building?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Framer wins overall (9.0/10 vs 8.3/10) with superior design quality (9.5/10 vs 8.5/10), better flexibility (9.0/10 vs 7.0/10), code export capability, and more affordable pricing starting at $5/month vs $23/month. Squarespace offers easier usability (8.5/10 vs 8.0/10), more mature platform with established reliability, all-in-one features without need for integrations, and consistently polished templates. Choose Squarespace for easy, polished, reliable websites. Choose Framer for stunning modern designs with more flexibility.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">What is the price difference between Squarespace and Framer?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Framer starts at $5/month for personal sites, $15/month for pro features, up to $30/month for advanced plans. Over 3 years, Framer costs $180-1080 depending on plan level. Squarespace starts at $23/month for personal websites, $33/month for business plans, up to $65/month for commerce features. Over 3 years, Squarespace costs $828-2340 depending on plan level. For all website types, Framer is more affordable ($5 vs $23/month base pricing, nearly 5x cheaper at entry level). Framer's aggressive pricing, combined with superior design quality, makes it exceptional value.

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can I export code from Squarespace or Framer?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Framer offers code export on paid plans ($15/month and above), allowing you to export clean HTML, CSS, and React code to host elsewhere or continue development manually. Squarespace does NOT offer code export - your website stays on Squarespace's servers permanently and you're locked into their platform. This is a major difference if you care about owning your code or having flexibility to migrate platforms. If code export matters for your long-term strategy, Framer is the clear winner. If you don't care about code export and want the easiest polished experience, Squarespace is the better choice.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Which platform has better AI features for website building?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Framer has superior AI capabilities with instant site generation from prompts, AI-powered design suggestions, and smart content creation. Its AI generates modern layouts that feel custom rather than template-based. Squarespace's AI is more limited - mainly suggesting templates and basic content suggestions. Framer's AI creates complete sites in seconds with contemporary design aesthetics. Squarespace's AI helps you pick templates but doesn't generate custom designs. For users prioritizing AI-powered site creation, Framer is clearly ahead with more sophisticated AI that produces better-looking results faster.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Is Squarespace or Framer better for e-commerce?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Squarespace is better for e-commerce with built-in inventory management, payment processing, shipping tools, and order management included. It's designed for online stores with mature e-commerce features. Framer has basic e-commerce through integrations like Stripe and Snipcart but lacks native e-commerce functionality. For serious online stores with products, inventory, and transactions, Squarespace is the better choice with its all-in-one e-commerce platform. Framer can work for simple digital products or basic sales but requires third-party tools. Choose Squarespace for full-featured e-commerce. Choose Framer for marketing sites with basic sales needs.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Which platform is easier to use for beginners?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Squarespace is easier for complete beginners with its polished templates, guided setup process, and intuitive drag-and-drop editor. Everything works predictably with minimal learning curve. Framer is also beginner-friendly but has more options and flexibility which can be overwhelming initially. Framer's AI helps beginners get started fast by generating complete sites. For non-technical users who want zero learning curve, Squarespace wins. For beginners willing to spend 30 minutes learning, Framer provides better results. Both are accessible, but Squarespace is more immediately user-friendly while Framer rewards slightly more learning with significantly better designs.

        <div class="pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can I switch from Squarespace to Framer or vice versa?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Switching from Squarespace to Framer is possible but requires manual rebuilding - you can't export your site from Squarespace. You'll need to recreate content and design in Framer. Switching from Framer to Squarespace also requires manual rebuilding since Squarespace has different template structure. Neither platform offers direct migration tools. If you're early in the build process, switching is manageable. If you have an established site, switching is significant work. The good news: both platforms make building fast with AI and templates. The best approach is to choose carefully upfront using this comparison. Framer users can export code if they want to leave entirely. Squarespace users are locked in unless they rebuild elsewhere.
