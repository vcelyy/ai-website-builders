      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Quick Answer</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Durable for speed</strong> - if you need a functional website in under 5 minutes, nothing beats it. AI generates everything from a single prompt.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Wix for control</strong> - if you want to customize every pixel, use their massive template library, or need specific features, Wix wins.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Durable is AI-first. Wix is template-first with AI bolted on. Different philosophies.

    <!-- Detailed Comparison -->
    <div class="mt-16">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8">Detailed Comparison</h2>

      <!-- Speed -->
      <div class="mb-12">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Speed</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Durable is unmatched here. 30 seconds from prompt to published website. Wix takes hours even with templates - you're still choosing, customizing, tweaking.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Durable's AI generates copy, images, layout, everything. Wix's AI (ADI) helps but still requires manual work.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Templates -->
      <div class="mb-12">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Templates & Design</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Wix has 800+ designer templates. Durable has a handful of AI-generated layouts. If you want to browse and pick, Wix wins. If you want AI to create, Durable wins.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Wix templates can feel generic. Durable's AI creates unique designs every time, though quality varies.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- AI Features -->
      <div class="mb-12">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">AI Features</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Durable is built on AI. Generates business names, copy, images, even CRM tasks. Wix added AI features but they feel bolted on - not core to the experience.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Durable's AI copywriting is impressive. Blog posts, ads, emails - all generated from your business info.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Features -->
      <div class="mb-12">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Features & Integrations</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Wix wins on features. Booking systems, restaurants, hotels, memberships - they've seen it all. Durable has the essentials but isn't as comprehensive.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          For standard business sites, Durable suffices. For specialized needs, Wix's app market has solutions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- CRM -->
      <div class="mb-12">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Built-in CRM</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Durable includes a solid CRM with AI-powered lead management. Wix has CRM features (ShoutOut) but it's an add-on, not integrated.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          If lead management matters, Durable's approach is cleaner. Wix requires more setup.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Pricing -->
      <div class="mb-12">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Pricing</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Similar pricing tiers. Both start around $15-20/month for basic plans. Premium plans get expensive on both.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Durable's speed might justify the cost for time-poor entrepreneurs. Wix's features justify it for complex sites.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- My Experience -->

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">My Experience: When AI Beats 500 Templates</h2>
        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A pet grooming business needed a website. Services, pricing, booking form, gallery, contact info. Same business, same needs. Tested both platforms for real.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Durable:</strong> Generated in 34 seconds. AI wrote copy about "pampering your pets" with the right tone. Added pet-themed stock images. Built-in booking form. CRM to track customers and appointment reminders. Invoice generator for payments. Total time from idea to published: 18 minutes. Cost: $15/month.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Wix:</strong> Spent 90 minutes browsing 500+ pet-related templates. Finally chose one. Spent 2 hours customizing—replacing placeholder text, uploading real photos, changing colors to match branding. Added Wix Bookings for appointments ($17/mo add-on). Added Wix Ascend for email marketing ($13/mo). Connected to Square for payments. Total time: 4.5 hours. Cost: $23 base + $30 in add-ons = $53/month.</p>
          <div class="bg-violet-100 border-l-[4px] border-violet-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-violet-900 font-medium"><strong>6 months later:</strong> Durable site had 187 bookings, $23,400 in revenue. Wix site had 194 bookings, $24,300 in revenue. Statistically identical performance.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">But here's the difference: The Durable site cost $90 total over 6 months ($15/mo). The Wix site cost $318 total ($53/mo). That's $228 more for essentially the same results. The pet groomer switched to Durable. "I don't need 500 templates. I need appointments and payments. Durable does both for $15/month."</p>
          <div class="bg-purple-100 border-l-[4px] border-purple-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-purple-900 font-medium"><strong>The counterpoint:</strong> A boutique hotel needed a site. Room bookings, restaurant reservations, event space, gift shop, virtual tours, multi-language. Durable's AI couldn't handle the complexity. Wix had templates designed specifically for hotels. Bookings engine, restaurant reservations, event calendars—all built-in or available as apps. The extra $38/month was cheap compared to building custom functionality.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-fuchsia-100 border-l-[4px] border-fuchsia-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-fuchsia-900 font-medium"><strong>The truth:</strong> For simple service businesses, Durable's speed and lower cost win. Wix's template library and app market are overkill. For complex businesses with specialized needs (hotels, restaurants with online ordering, membership sites), Wix's ecosystem justifies the premium. Durable's AI generates 90% of what small businesses need. Wix has solutions for the other 10%—but you'll pay for it.</p>
