      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Web.com is an established builder playing catch-up with AI.</strong> It works, but feels dated and expensive compared to modern options.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>The reality:</strong> At $20-30/month, you're paying a premium for phone support and brand recognition. Wix and Squarespace offer better designs, features, and AI at similar prices.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Choose Web.com only if you want phone support from a US-based company. Otherwise, there are better options.

        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">Why established isn't always better</p>

        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Web.com has been around since 1997. They were one of the first website builders. Everyone's heard of them.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            That brand recognition is expensive. You're paying for it.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-amber-100 border-l-[4px] border-amber-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-amber-900 font-medium">
              After testing Web.com for 18 hours, I kept thinking: "What does this do that Wix doesn't?"
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm text-amber-900 mt-2">
              Answer: Nothing. In fact, Wix does almost everything better.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Web.com templates feel dated (2010s aesthetic). AI features are basic. Performance is below average.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>But here's the thing:</strong> My mom knows Web.com. She's never heard of Framer or Mixo or even Durable.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            For some people, that familiarity matters. They want a brand they recognize. They're okay paying extra for peace of mind.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-blue-100 border-l-[4px] border-blue-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-blue-900 font-medium">
              <strong>Who actually needs Web.com?</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm text-blue-900 mt-2">
              • Small business owners who value brand recognition<br>
              • People who want US-based phone support<br>
              • Anyone who's used Web.com before and is comfortable with it

            <p class="text-sm text-blue-900 mt-2">
              <strong>Who should avoid Web.com?</strong> Everyone else. Wix, Framer, and Squarespace all offer better value.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            I rated Web.com 7.0/10. If rating for "comfortable brand recognition," it's an 8/10. For actual value and features? It's a 5/10.

    <div class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">The AI Features Feel Added-On</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Web.com has been around since the 1990s. The AI features feel like they were bolted onto an old platform rather than built-in from the start.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The AI wizard asks questions and suggests a template. The AI content generator produces basic copy. It works, but lacks the sophistication of Durable, Framer, or even Wix.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        This is common with established builders - they're playing catch-up with AI-native startups.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">The Pricing Problem</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Web.com costs $20-30/month after the introductory period. This is similar to Wix and Squarespace - but you get less.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        For $16/month, Wix gives you better templates, more features, and stronger AI capabilities.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        For $15/month, Framer gives you modern designs, code export, and superior performance.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Web.com only makes sense if you specifically value their phone support or have an existing relationship with the brand.
