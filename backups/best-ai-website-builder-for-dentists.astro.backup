            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Dr. Sarah Morrison, general dentistry practice in Austin TX (established 2017). Website from 2016: broken mobile layout, stock photos of smiling people (not real patients), services buried 4 clicks deep, "Book Appointment" downloaded PDF form. Modern facility with digital X-rays, intraoral cameras, sedation dentistry. Zero visible online. New patients: 8-12/month despite 200,000+ population in 10-mile radius. Competitor 2 miles away: beautiful Squarespace site with virtual tour, team bios, before/after gallery. They were getting 30-40 new patients/month.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Complete Squarespace rebuild. I added: virtual photo tour of the modern facility (no more stock photos), detailed service pages (cosmetic dentistry, implants, emergency care, pediatric dentistry, sedation options), team bios with "Why I became a dentist" personal stories, before/after smile gallery with proper consent, online booking via Acuity Scheduling (24/7), "EMERGENCY DENTAL: 24/7" header with click-to-call phone, patient testimonials video gallery, insurance providers list prominently displayed.

Patient no-shows: dropped 43% (patients felt more committed after seeing the facility online). Cosmetic consultations: 2-3/month to 8-11/month (+233%) thanks to the before/after gallery. Average treatment value per new patient: increased $340 (patients trusted more, accepted larger treatment plans). Revenue: +$68,000/year in new patient revenue alone. ROI: 3,571% in first year.
