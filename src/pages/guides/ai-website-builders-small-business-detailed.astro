Durable offers built-in CRM features with fastest setup (30 seconds) ideal for lead generation and business automation. Squarespace works well for local retail and image-focused businesses wanting beautiful product displays and professional polish. Framer delivers the best designs in class (9.5/10) for design-conscious businesses wanting modern aesthetic. For most small businesses, prioritize: clear contact information and location details, mobile optimization (most traffic is mobile), business hours and services prominently displayed, lead capture forms for inquiries, social media and review links, fast loading speed, and professional appearance that builds trust. Your website exists to get customers to contact you or visit your location."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "AI website builders are absolutely sufficient for 95% of small businesses. Modern AI builders create professional small business websites with all key features including contact forms, location information, service displays, mobile optimization, and professional designs. Custom development costs thousands more and takes weeks longer. The only small businesses that might need custom websites are those with highly specific technical requirements, complex inventory management systems, unique interactive features, or substantial budget for differentiation. For restaurants, retail, professional services, local businesses, and most small companies, AI builders provide professional results at a fraction of the cost and time. Your customers care about finding your location, seeing your hours, understanding what you offer, and easily contacting you. AI builders handle all of this beautifully."

Everything should drive customer action - call, visit, or email. Your website is your 24/7 salesperson."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "For most small businesses starting out, spend as little as possible while maintaining professionalism. Mixo at $9/month creates excellent business websites with minimal cost. Durable at $15/month adds CRM features valuable for lead generation. As your business grows and website proves its worth through customer inquiries, upgrading to Squarespace ($23/mo) or Framer ($15-30/mo) makes sense for design quality and advanced features. Critical formula: if your website generates $500+ in annual revenue or saves 5+ hours monthly in time, spending $120-300/year (10-25% of value) is completely justified. Many small businesses overspend on fancy websites before proving business viability. Better approach: start with budget option ($9-15/mo), prove ROI through inquiries and sales, then upgrade if needed. Your limited budget goes farther on business growth and marketing than on expensive website technology."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Small business website traffic comes from multiple sources. Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) is critical for local businesses - it's free, puts you on Google Maps, and drives local search traffic. Local SEO optimization with city keywords and service terms helps nearby customers find you. Social media marketing on Facebook and Instagram drives followers to your website. Email signature and business cards include your website URL. Online directories like Yelp, Yellow Pages, and industry-specific listings provide backlinks and visibility. Google Ads can drive immediate traffic for urgent needs but costs money. For local businesses: Google Business Profile + local SEO + social media + email marketing = comprehensive traffic strategy. Track what works using analytics and double down on successful channels."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "For most small businesses, DIY AI builders are the smart choice. Cost comparison: Mixo at $9/month vs professional development at $3,000-10,000. DIY builders launch in days vs months for custom development. AI builders enable you to make updates instantly without waiting on developers or paying hourly fees. Consider hiring professionals only if: you have complex technical needs beyond AI builder capabilities, you have substantial budget ($5,000+ for website), your time is worth more than the DIY learning curve, or you need highly specialized features. For restaurants, retail, professional services, and local businesses: AI builders are completely sufficient. The $3,000-10,000 you'd spend on custom development creates far more business value when invested in marketing, inventory, equipment, or business development. Build with DIY first, upgrade only when ROI is clear."

          "text": "Successful small business websites share these characteristics: mobile-first design since 70%+ traffic is mobile, clear contact information above fold on every page, prominent business hours and location info, fast loading under 3 seconds (slow sites lose visitors), professional photos that build trust and credibility, customer testimonials with specific results, clear call-to-action buttons (call now, get directions, request quote), active social media integration showing recent activity, online reviews prominently displayed, special offers or current promotions visible above fold, and answers to common customer questions. Critical: make contact easy, provide key information upfront, load quickly on mobile, build trust through professional appearance and social proof. Your website converts better when it feels legitimate and trustworthy."
