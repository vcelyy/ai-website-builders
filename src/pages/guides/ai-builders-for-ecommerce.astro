						What e-commerce actually needs
					</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Before we talk about tools, let's be clear about what e-commerce requires:
					</p>

					<ul class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<li><strong>Product management:</strong> SKUs, variants (sizes/colors), inventory tracking, bulk uploads</li>
						<li><strong>Payment processing:</strong> Stripe, PayPal, multiple currencies, tax calculation</li>
						<li><strong>Shipping:</strong> Rates, zones, tracking integration, label printing</li>
						<li><strong>Customer accounts:</strong> Order history, saved addresses, wishlists</li>
						<li><strong>Security:</strong> SSL, PCI compliance, fraud protection</li>
						<li><strong>Abandoned cart:</strong> Email recovery, retargeting</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Most AI builders handle 2-3 of these. Actual e-commerce platforms handle all of them. That's the difference.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
							<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
						10Web + WooCommerce: Actually works
					</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						This is the only AI builder combo that's genuinely viable for e-commerce. Here's why:
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What works</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						10Web gives you WordPress + WooCommerce. That means you get the full e-commerce platform with AI-assisted setup. The AI generates your store design, product pages, category structure. WooCommerce handles everything else.<br /><br />
						Full product management? Yes. Variants, inventory, bulk uploads? Yes. Payment processing? Yes. Shipping? Yes. Customer accounts? Yes.<br /><br />
						This is real e-commerce, not a toy store builder.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What doesn't work</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						WordPress overhead. Your store will be slower than Shopify or BigCommerce. Page load times of 2-3 seconds are common. You'll need caching plugins, image optimization, possibly a CDN.<br /><br />
						Also, you're responsible for updates, security, backups. 10Web handles some of this, but WordPress is inherently higher-maintenance than hosted solutions.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Real example: Clothing brand</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Fashion brand needed online store with 200 products, multiple variants (size/color), inventory tracking. Used 10Web AI to generate store structure—product grids, category pages, checkout flow. Then manually added products.<br /><br />
						Launch took 3 days vs 2+ weeks for custom WooCommerce build. Store is slower than Shopify (2.8s vs 1.2s load time) but fully functional and saving $300/month in platform fees.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
							<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
						Durable: Only for very simple stores
					</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Durable has e-commerce features. They're basic. Like, really basic.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What works</h3>
						<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
							If you're selling 5-10 products with no variants, Durable works. Simple product pages. Stripe payment integration. Basic shipping. That's it.<br /><br />
							Generates the store in 28 seconds. Launch same day. If your needs are minimal, it's insanely fast.
						</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What doesn't work</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						No product variants. Can't do "t-shirt in 5 sizes and 3 colors." No inventory tracking. No bulk product uploads. No abandoned cart emails. No customer accounts.<br /><br />
						Also: zero export. If you outgrow Durable, you're rebuilding from scratch. Export your product data? Good luck.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Real example: Digital products</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Course creator selling 3 digital products. No variants, no inventory, no shipping complexity. Durable worked perfectly—generated sales pages, checkout, delivery in minutes. Saving $300/month vs Shopify.<br /><br />
						But if they'd added physical products with sizes/colors, they'd have hit walls immediately.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
							<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
						Framer: Not for e-commerce
					</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Framer has payment integration via Stripe or Gumroad. That's where it ends.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What works (barely)</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						You can add Stripe checkout to a Framer site. Connect Gumroad for products. That's it. No cart. No product management. No inventory. No customer accounts.<br /><br />
						This works for selling one thing—a course, a template, a digital download. Not a store.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What doesn't work</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Everything else. No product catalog. No variants. No inventory. No shipping. No tax calculation. No customer accounts. No order management.<br /><br />
						Framer is for marketing sites, not stores. Don't fight it.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Real example: Failed expansion</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Designer used Framer for portfolio. Added Gumroad to sell templates. Worked great. Decided to expand into physical products—t-shirts, prints.<br /><br />
						Couldn't do it in Framer. No variants, no cart, no shipping. Spent 2 months rebuilding in Shopify. Should have started there or used 10Web + WooCommerce from day one.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
							<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
						Relume: For planning, not building
					</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Relume doesn't host stores. It generates wireframes for them.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How to use it</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Plan your e-commerce site structure in Relume: homepage, product pages, category pages, checkout flow. Export to Framer (not recommended for e-commerce) or Webflow (better).<br /><br />
						Relume helps with information architecture—how many products per page, what filters, how checkout should flow. Then you build in an actual e-commerce platform.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">When it's worth it</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						If you're building a complex store with hundreds of products, planning structure first saves time. But for simple stores, it's overkill.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
							<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
						The alternatives: Actual e-commerce platforms
					</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Sometimes you skip AI builders entirely and use real e-commerce platforms:
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Shopify</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<strong>Best for:</strong> Serious e-commerce businesses. $29-299/month.<br /><br />
						No AI website generation, but full e-commerce platform. Handles everything: products, payments, shipping, inventory, taxes, analytics. Thousands of plugins. Scales from 10 products to 100,000.<br /><br />
						If you're building a real business, pay the $29/month. It's worth it.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">BigCommerce</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<strong>Best for:</strong> Mid-market to enterprise. $29-299/month.<br /><br />
						Similar to Shopify but more flexible. Better multi-storefront support. More headless commerce options. If you don't know what that means, you probably don't need it.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">WooCommerce (self-hosted WordPress)</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<strong>Best for:</strong> Technical users who want full control. Free plugin, pay for hosting.<br /><br />
						Same as 10Web but without the AI assistance. You build everything yourself. More work, more control. Great if you know WordPress.
					</p>

						Bottom line
					</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						For e-commerce, AI builders are limited. 10Web + WooCommerce is the only combo that gives you AI assistance with real e-commerce features. Durable works for very simple stores. Framer isn't for e-commerce at all.<br /><br />
						If you're serious about selling online, pay for Shopify or build with WooCommerce. AI website generation is cool, but not worth crippling your store functionality.
