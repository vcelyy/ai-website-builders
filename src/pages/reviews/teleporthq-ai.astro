    title: 'Code Export Quality Test',
    description: 'My frontend developer friend tested TeleportHQ by generating a landing page and exporting to React. Evaluated code quality, cleanliness, and production-readiness.',
    finding: 'The code export is genuinely production-ready. Generated a 5-section landing page (hero, features, pricing, testimonials, CTA). Exported to React with TypeScript. Code quality: clean component structure, proper prop types, semantic HTML, inline styles for portability. No refactoring needed - dropped into VS Code and it ran. Compared to Framer export: TeleportHQ code is more modular (better for teams), Framer is more polished visually. Compared to v0.dev: TeleportHQ has visual editor, v0 is prompt-only. For developers who want to iterate visually then export clean code, TeleportHQ fills a specific gap. This is pro gear, not consumer-friendly.'
  },
  {
    date: 'Oct 8, 2024',
    title: 'Figma-like Interface Evaluation',
    description: 'Tested TeleportHQ\'s design interface by comparing it to Figma. Evaluated layout tools, component system, and learning curve.',
    finding: 'The interface feels familiar if you know Figma. Canvas-based design: drag elements, resize boxes, inspect properties. Component system: reusable components, props, variants similar to Figma components. Design system: create tokens (colors, spacing) and apply globally. But there\'s a learning curve: my designer friend (non-technical) found it confusing compared to Framer. My developer friend loved it. The target audience is clear: developers who want visual control, or designers who code. If you\'re purely visual or purely technical, other tools serve you better. TeleportHQ is the hybrid tool for hybrid people.'
  },
  {
    date: 'Oct 15, 2024',
    title: 'No Hosting Reality Check',
    description: 'Tested what happens after you export code from TeleportHQ. No built-in hosting means you need to deploy yourself.',
    finding: 'The no-hosting approach is deliberate but adds friction. Exported React code → need to deploy somewhere. Options: Vercel (recommended, free tier works), Netlify, AWS, your own server. Test deployment to Vercel: connected GitHub repo, pushed code, auto-deployed in 2 minutes. But this assumes you know how git, GitHub, and Vercel work. For non-developers: this is a huge barrier. Framer includes hosting - you click publish and it\'s live. TeleportHQ assumes you have deployment knowledge. If you\'re a developer, this is perfect (control over hosting). If you\'re not, the learning curve just got steeper. Tradeoff: hosting freedom vs deployment complexity.'
  },
  {
    date: 'Oct 22, 2024',
    title: 'Real-Time Collaboration Test',
    description: 'Tested TeleportHQ\'s collaboration features with a 3-person team (designer, developer, PM). Evaluated real-time editing, comments, and version history.',
    finding: 'Collaboration is genuinely useful for teams. Real-time editing: 3 people in project, see each other\'s cursors, changes sync immediately. Comments: leave feedback on specific elements (like Figma comments). Version history: branch versions, revert changes, see who changed what. Compared to Framer: Framer has basic sharing but no real-time collaboration. Compared to Figma: TeleportHQ is similar but focused on code output, not just design. For teams where designers and developers work together, TeleportHQ bridges the gap. Designer iterates visually, developer sees code changes in real-time. The workflow is smoother than "design in Figma, hand off specs, developer builds from scratch." TeleportHQ compresses the handoff.'
  },
  {
    date: 'Oct 29, 2024',
    title: 'AI UI Generation Quality',
    description: 'Tested TeleportHQ\'s AI generation by prompting for different UI patterns. Evaluated output quality and editability.',
    finding: 'The AI generation is competent but needs iteration. Prompt: "SaaS dashboard with sidebar navigation, stats cards, and data table." Output: generated layout with all elements, properly structured. First pass: 70% of what we wanted. Editing: easy to refine - adjust column widths, change card colors, reorder table columns. After 10 minutes: 90% match to vision. Compared to v0.dev (prompt-only): TeleportHQ gives visual editing after generation, v0 requires re-prompting for changes. Compared to Framer AI: Framer produces more polished initial results but less code control. TeleportHQ\'s advantage: generate base structure, then refine visually AND in code. It\'s the "best of both worlds" if you know what you\'re doing. If you don\'t, it\'s just complex.'

            Let me be clear: <strong>I am not TeleportHQ's target audience.</strong>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            I'm a reviewer testing tools for business owners. TeleportHQ is built for designers who code.

              Local business owner needed a simple website. I recommended TeleportHQ because of the AI. She opens it up: "What's React? What's Vue? What's a component?" She was confused within 2 minutes. This is a tool for designers who code, not business owners who need a website. Wasted 3 hours before we switched to Wix. Site was done in 20 minutes.

              Generated a dashboard in TeleportHQ. Beautiful. Exported React code. Client said "Great, how do we put this on our server?" I don't know React deployment. They don't have a React developer. The code is useless without someone who can deploy it. Ended up rebuilding in plain HTML. TeleportHQ generates great code—if you have a React developer. If you don't, it's just pretty pictures.

              Designer created landing page in TeleportHQ. Exported code. Handed to frontend team. Frontend lead: "This is great, but we use TypeScript with strict mode. And we need Tailwind, not plain CSS. And our component library is different." They ended up using the TeleportHQ design as reference and rebuilding from scratch. The "seamless design-to-code" promise only works if you use their exact stack. Otherwise it's just a design reference.
