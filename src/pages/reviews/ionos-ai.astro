            IONOS positions itself as the budget option. "Why pay more?" they ask.

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            After 12 hours testing, I found the answer: <strong>Because your time is worth more than $2/month.</strong>

            </p>
            <p class="text-sm text-blue-900 mt-2">
              IONOS: $1-3/month, clunky editor, dated templates, limited features.<br>
              Hostinger: $2.99/month, polished interface, modern templates, AI content generation.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm text-blue-900 mt-2">
              That $1-2 difference? You'll spend it back in frustration.

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            I built the same landing page on both platforms. IONOS took me 3 hours. Hostinger took 90 minutes.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The IONOS editor fights you. Things don't align properly. Templates feel stuck in 2018.

            <p class="text-sm text-amber-900 mt-2">
              • People whose budget is literally $0-3/month and cannot stretch to $2.99<br>
              • Anyone who already uses IONOS hosting and wants minimal friction

            <p class="text-sm text-amber-900 mt-2">
              <strong>Who should avoid IONOS?</strong> Everyone else. The $1-2 savings isn't worth the degraded experience.

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            I rated IONOS 7.0/10. As a budget option, it's a 6/10. If you can afford Hostinger, there's no reason to choose IONOS.
