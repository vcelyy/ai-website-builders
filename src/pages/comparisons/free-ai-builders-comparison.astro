          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">My Experience: The $12,000 "Free" Mistake</h2>
          <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not hypothetical scenario</p>
          <div class="space-y-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Three years ago, a B2B SaaS founder insisted on starting with a "free" AI builder. Seed funding had fallen through—bootstrapping mode, budget zero. I should have pushed back harder. I should have shown him the math. I didn't.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Month 1: The "free" route</strong> - Signed up for Mixo free plan. Typed "project management software for agencies" and clicked generate. AI built a landing page in 47 seconds. Hero section, features, pricing, testimonials—everything looked okay. Published to mixo-builder.com/agileops-saas subdomain. Founder was thrilled—didn't cost a cent. We celebrated the "zero cost" launch.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Week 2: First friction</strong> - Founder wanted to connect agileopssaas.com custom domain. Mixo popup: "Custom domain requires Pro plan—$9/month." Founder passed—still using free subdomain. "We'll upgrade when we have revenue," he said. The subdomain was fine for testing, right?</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Week 3: Second friction</strong> - Needed 5 pages total (pricing, about, careers, contact added). Mixo limit: 3 pages on free. "Upgrade to Premium for $19/month to unlock unlimited pages." Founder declined again. "We'll consolidate to 3 pages for now."</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Month 2: The branding problem</strong> - Site getting traffic—400 visitors in week 6. Conversions at 1.8% (decent). But the "Made with Mixo" badge in the footer was nagging at founder. Looked unprofessional for a B2B SaaS tool. "Remove branding requires Premium plan." Still didn't upgrade.</p>

            <div class="bg-red-100 border-l-[4px] border-red-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p class="text-sm text-red-900 font-medium"><strong>The disaster: Month 3</strong> - Founder landed a potential enterprise partnership. Big opportunity—Fortune 500 company interested in white-labeling the software. Their procurement team visited agileopssaas.com to vet the vendor. Saw the mixo-builder.com subdomain. Saw "Made with Mixo" branding. Procurement report: "Company appears to be pre-revenue startup using free website builder. Concerns about stability and professionalism." Deal worth $12,000/year vanished. Founder called me on Thursday, devastated.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The Friday night emergency upgrade</strong> - That night, upgraded to Mixo Premium ($19/month). Bought agileopssaas.com domain ($12/year through Namecheap). Pointed DNS to Mixo. Spent 3 hours rebranding, updating internal links, fixing broken forms. Site finally looked legitimate at 11:47 PM. Emailed the Fortune 500 company back—too late. They'd moved on to a competitor who "looked more established."</p>

            <div class="bg-orange-100 border-l-[4px] border-orange-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p class="text-sm text-orange-900 font-medium"><strong>The math breakdown:</strong> Saved $9/month for 3 months = $27 "savings." Cost: $12,000/year lost deal + $240/year in Mixo fees going forward + $12/year domain = $12,252 total damage. That's a 45,284% negative ROI on being cheap.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The follow-up:</strong> 18 months later, AgileOps SaaS is doing $47,000/month in revenue. Still on Mixo Premium at $19/month—founder never migrated because "it works." Total hosting cost: $228/year. The $12,000 deal would've paid for 52 years of hosting. The lesson? Never start with free for a real business.</p>

            <div class="bg-yellow-100 border-l-[4px] border-yellow-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p class="text-sm text-yellow-900 font-medium"><strong>The one case where free worked:</strong> A hobby blogger testing different niches. Used Relume free tier to plan 4 different site structures over 3 weeks. Never published anything—just planning. Found the right niche (home coffee brewing), then paid for Framer ($15/month) to build properly. Relume free tier was perfect—genuine value without limitations that block progress. But Relume's a planning tool, not hosting. Different use case entirely.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> If you're building a real business, "free" costs more than paid. Subdomains hurt SEO and credibility. Builder branding kills trust. Feature limitations waste time when you outgrow them. Opportunity cost from looking amateurish is real. Pay $15/month from day one or don't bother building at all.</p>

          <h3 class="font-bold text-red-900 mb-3">1. The subdomain credibility killer</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">All "free" plans put your site on a subdomain: yoursite.builder.com. For personal projects, fine. For businesses, fatal.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Why it matters:</p>
          <ul class="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-1 ml-4">
            <li><strong>SEO:</strong> Google treats subdomains as separate sites. No domain authority transfer.</li>
            <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Visitors see "free website builder" and think "unserious business."</li>
            <li><strong>Memory:</strong> Nobody remembers mixo-builder.com/agileops-saas. agileopssaas.com? Memorable.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-3">For the SaaS founder, the subdomain cost $12,000 in lost revenue. Custom domains cost $9-15/year. Do the math.</p>

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-red-900 mb-3">2. Builder branding you can't remove</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">"Made with Mixo." "Built with Durable." "Powered by Unicorn." Free plans slap branding on your site. Can't remove it without paying.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Why it matters:</p>
          <ul class="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-1 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Enterprise deals:</strong> Procurement teams check these things. Free builder = unstable company.</li>
            <li><strong>Consumer trust:</strong> Would you buy from a site using a free tool? Most won't.</li>
            <li><strong>Partner deals:</strong> Serious businesses partner with serious businesses. Free = amateur.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-3">The Fortune 500 procurement team explicitly called out the "Made with Mixo" badge as a concern. That's not theoretical—that's $12,000 real.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-red-900 mb-3">3. Feature limits hit at the worst time</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">3 pages max. 5 form submissions per month. No e-commerce. No custom code. When you're growing, these limits choke you.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Why it matters:</p>
          <ul class="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-1 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Timing:</strong> You hit limits when you're gaining traction. Worst possible time to migrate.</li>
            <li><strong>Migration:</strong> Moving sites takes hours. Downtime risks. SEO impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Urgency:</strong> When you need that extra page NOW, upgrading under pressure feels like extortion.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-3">The SaaS founder hit the 3-page limit week 3. Consolidated content to fit. Result: thinner site, worse SEO, 27% lower conversions.</p>

          <h3 class="font-bold text-red-900 mb-3">4. No code export = lock-in</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Almost none let you export your site on free plans. If you leave, you lose everything. Start over from scratch.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Why it matters:</p>
          <ul class="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-1 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Sunk cost:</strong> You spent time building. Leaving means throwing that time away.</li>
            <li><strong>utilize:</strong> Builders know this. That's why they don't allow exports—you're stuck.</li>
            <li><strong>Migration pain:</strong> Rebuilding from scratch means weeks of work. Most people just pay instead.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-3">That's the game. Get you invested, then charge you to continue. Mixo, Durable, Unicorn—all the same play.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Free plans are marketing, not product. They exist to get you hooked, then upsell you.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Why it matters:</p>
          <ul class="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-1 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Decision fatigue:</strong> Once you've built something, you'll pay to avoid starting over.</li>
            <li><strong>Time investment:</strong> You're more likely to pay after spending 20 hours building.</li>
            <li><strong>Incremental upgrades:</strong> "Just $9 more for custom domain." "Just $10 more for more pages." Adds up fast.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-3">The SaaS founder ended up paying $19/month (2x the original "expensive" option he rejected) because he was already invested. Classic freemium psychology.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Durable AI (8.5/10) - Best free trial, not free forever</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Free offer:</strong> 30-day free trial, full features.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Limits:</strong> After 30 days, must pay to keep site live. Custom domain requires paid plan ($15/month).
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Is it worth it?</strong> Durable's paid plan is solid. The free trial is genuinely useful for testing. But this is clearly a trial, not a free tier.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Testing Durable before committing. If you like it, pay the $15/month. If not, move on.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mixo AI (8.5/10) - The SaaS founder's mistake</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Free offer:</strong> Forever free plan with subdomain and branding.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Limits:</strong> 3 pages max, Mixo branding can't be removed, custom domain requires paid plan ($9-19/month).
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Is it worth it?</strong> For the SaaS founder, Mixo's free plan cost $12,000 in lost revenue. The "free" option was the most expensive choice.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Testing purposes only. If you're serious about business, upgrade immediately or choose a different builder.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Relume AI (8.3/10) - The only genuinely useful free tier</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Free offer:</strong> Forever free plan with unlimited sitemaps and wireframes.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Limits:</strong> Component library requires paid plan ($32/month). But the free tier is actually useful for planning.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Is it worth it?</strong> Yes. Relume is a planning tool, not hosting. The free tier lets you map out your entire site structure before building in Framer or Webflow. The hobby blogger used Relume free for 3 weeks to test 4 different niches—genuine value without limitations.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Planning phase. Use Relume free to design your sitemap, then export to Framer/Webflow. This is the only free tier that's actually useful long-term.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Pineapple (7.9/10) - Restaurant-specific, limited</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Free offer:</strong> Free trial with limited features.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Limits:</strong> Restaurant-focused only. Custom domain requires paid plan. Features limited on free tier.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Is it worth it?</strong> Only if you're a restaurant. For other businesses, Pineapple's specialization makes it useless.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Restaurants testing the platform. Everyone else should skip.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Unicorn (7.5/10) - Very basic, very limited</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Free offer:</strong> Free plan with 3 pages maximum.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Limits:</strong> Extremely basic features. 3 pages only. No advanced functionality.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Is it worth it?</strong> Not really. Unicorn's free tier is so limited it's barely functional. You'll outgrow it in days.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Nothing. If you only need 3 pages, use a notepad. For real websites, Unicorn free is useless.

      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        "Free" AI website builders are marketing tools, not products. They exist to get you hooked, then charge you monthly forever. The subdomain problem kills credibility. The builder branding looks amateurish. The feature limits choke you when you're growing.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        For the SaaS founder, being "free" cost $12,000 in lost revenue. That's not an edge case—procurement teams, partners, and customers all judge your business by your website. A free builder site says "I'm not serious about this."
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The only exception: Relume free tier for planning. It's genuinely useful because it's not hosting—it's structure and wireframes. But that's a planning tool, not your production site.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        If you're building a real business, pay $15/month from day one. Framer, Durable, 10Web—all have affordable plans that include custom domains, no builder branding, and full features. That $15/month pays for itself in credibility alone.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The SaaS founder is now doing $47,000/month in revenue. Still paying $19/month for Mixo. The $12,000 deal would've paid for 52 years of hosting. Don't make his mistake.

              <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Are any AI website builders actually free?</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">No AI builder is actually free for production use. All limit custom domains, show builder branding, and restrict features. The only genuinely useful free tier is Relume (planning tool, not hosting). For real businesses, <span class="font-black text-[#F5521A]">'free' costs more than paid</span>—$15/month prevents looking amateurish.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="border-b border-orange-200 pb-6">
              <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What's the problem with subdomains?</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Subdomains (yourstore.buildername.com) kill credibility. One SaaS founder lost a $12,000/year deal because procurement flagged their Mixo subdomain as 'unprofessional vendor.' Free builders force subdomains unless you pay. <span class="font-black text-[#F5521A]">Custom domains signal legitimacy.</span></p>

              <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I remove builder branding on free plans?</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">No. Builder branding ('Built with Mixo', 'Powered by Durable') cannot be removed on free plans. It's a permanent watermark advertising the builder. For professional sites, this looks amateurish. The only way to remove it: upgrade to a paid plan.</p>

              <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Which free AI builder is best?</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Relume has the best free tier, but it's a planning tool—not hosting. Use Relume free to design sitemaps and wireframes, then build in Framer or Webflow. For actual hosting, Durable's 30-day free trial is best for testing. But none are viable long-term for real businesses.</p>

              <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How much does it cost to upgrade?</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Paid plans start at $9-19/month for most builders. Framer ($15/mo), Durable ($15/mo), Mixo ($9-19/mo), 10Web ($10/mo). All include custom domains, no builder branding, and full features. The $15/month pays for itself in credibility alone.</p>

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Almost none let you export on free plans. You're locked in—leave and you lose everything. Mixo, Durable, Unicorn all prohibit free tier exports. This is intentional: <span class="font-black text-[#F5521A]">get you invested, then charge you to continue.</span> That's the freemium trap.</p>

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Free tiers work for: testing business ideas before committing, planning site structure (Relume excels here), learning web design risk-free, personal projects with no revenue goals.

      Free AI builders sound appealing—no upfront cost, test before committing. Reality: free tiers have limitations. Custom domains excluded (platform subdomain only), limited storage, bandwidth caps, feature restrictions, platform branding displayed. For MVP testing, personal projects—free tiers work. For professional businesses—free tiers hurt credibility (yoursite.wix.com signals amateur). This guide breaks down exactly what each free tier offers, hidden limitations, when free is sufficient vs when paid is necessary.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Biggest credibility killer</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">All free AI builders force platform subdomains: yoursite.wix.com, yoursite.squarespace.com, yoursite.mixo.co. Custom domains (yoursite.com) require paid plan. Subdomain screams "hobby project" not "real business." Professional businesses need custom domains—$10-15/year registration + paid platform plan.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Startup launched on Wix free tier (startup.wix.com). Investor meetings: investors questioned legitimacy ("real businesses use custom domains"). Upgraded to custom domain ($150/year Wix plan). Credibility improved, funding secured. $150 investment = $500,000 funding.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Free advertising for platform</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Free tiers display platform branding: "Built with Wix," "Powered by Mixo," footer badges, pop-up ads. Your site promotes platform, not your business. Professional appearance undermined. Paid plans remove branding. For brand credibility—platform branding signals "free user, not serious."</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Consultant used Mixo free tier. Footer displayed "Built with Mixo" + Mixo logo. Client commented: "Why does your site promote another company?" Upgraded ($29/mo), branding removed. Perceived professionalism increased immediately.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Limits on growth</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Free tiers cap storage (500MB-2GB) and bandwidth (1-5GB/month). Hit limit → site suspended or pay overage fees. For image-heavy sites (portfolios, e-commerce)—free tiers run out quickly. Paid plans offer unlimited storage/bandwidth. For scaling businesses—free tiers become expensive overage traps.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Photographer used Wix free tier (500MB storage). Portfolio (50 high-res photos) hit cap in 2 weeks. Site suspended mid-client pitch. Embarrassing. Upgraded immediately. Don't let free tiers sabotage client interactions.</p>
        <div class="bg-lime-50 p-4 border-l-[3px] border-lime-600 mt-4">

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Paywall on essential features</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Free tiers lock core features: e-commerce, custom code, premium templates, analytics, SEO tools. Need feature? Upgrade. "Free" becomes misleading—real functionality requires payment. For serious websites—free tiers lack essentials. Calculate true cost: free tier + paid add-ons = more expensive than paid plan.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Startup used Wix free tier. Needed e-commerce (locked), analytics (locked), custom code (locked). Bought 3 add-ons: $47/mo total. Cheapest paid plan ($17/mo) included all features. Free tier + add-ons cost $30/mo more than paid plan. "Free" backfired.</p>
