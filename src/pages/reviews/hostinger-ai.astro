    finding: '$2.99/month is real but comes with strings. Requires 48-month commitment ($143.52 upfront). Month-to-month: $7.99/month. Domain is free first year only ($12/year after). SSL is free forever. AI features work on the cheapest plan—no upsell. Total first-year cost: $155.52 with domain. That\'s still cheaper than one month of some competitors.

The AI asks 3 questions (business name, industry, description) and generates a complete site. But the quality is 2015-level basic. Templates feel dated, stock photos are generic, layouts are boxy.

No personality, no brand voice. You\'ll rewrite 80% of it. AI Image Generator produces usable but basic images. Generated 5 hero images: 2 were acceptable, 3 looked like clip art.

Layouts: locked sections, can\'t move elements between sections. Add sections: only from limited library (hero, features, testimonials, contact). Moving elements: drag-and-drop within sections only.

    finding: 'Hostinger beats budget competitors on value. Namecheap ($2.98/mo): similar price, worse templates, no AI Writer. Ionos ($1/mo first year, $12/mo after): bait-and-switch pricing, dated editor. GoDaddy ($9.99/mo): better templates, 3x the price. Hostinger\'s advantage: AI features work on cheapest plan, SSL included forever, hosting is fast and reliable. Tradeoff: dated design, limited customization.

              • Testing a business idea before investing in a proper site<br>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            I rated Hostinger 7.8/10. The score would be lower if not for the price. If Hostinger cost $15/month? It'd be a 5/10.

            But at $2.99? It earns points just for existing. Sometimes "cheap and functional" is exactly what you need.

        Hostinger = web hosting giant (domain registration, email, servers).<br/>

        Great if you need hosting anyway. Overkill if you only want website.<br/>

          <p>Hostinger's hosting infrastructure is excellent. Sites load in 1-2 seconds, comparable to Framer/Durable, faster than Squarespace/Wix. This is Hostinger's real advantage - they're a hosting company first, so servers are fast and reliable.</p>
          <p class="font-bold mb-2 mt-4">Impact:</p>
          <p>Fast loading means 5-7% abandonment rate (excellent). For most businesses, Hostinger's speed advantage over Squarespace (2-3s) doesn't matter significantly. Only critical for ecommerce where speed = sales.</p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
          <strong>Use Hostinger AI if:</strong> You need full hosting stack (domains, email, databases, servers). You're hosting multiple websites. You want cheapest all-in-one solution. You're comfortable with renewal pricing hikes. The convenience of bundled services justifies average AI builder quality.<br/>
          <strong>Choose alternatives if:</strong> You only want website builder (no hosting needed). You want better AI generation (Mixo 7.5-8/10 vs Hostinger 6/10). You want better design (Framer 9.5/10 vs Hostinger 7/10). You want flat pricing without renewal hikes (Durable $180/year flat vs Hostinger renewal increases).<br/>
          <strong>My recommendation:</strong> Most users: Choose Durable. $180/year flat, better AI generation (7/10 vs 6/10), comparable design (7.5/10 vs 7/10), no renewal surprises. Only choose Hostinger if you genuinely need hosting infrastructure (domains, email, databases). If you just want a website, Hostinger is overkill and you're paying for features you won't use.<br/>
          <strong>Remember:</strong> Hostinger is a hosting company that added AI builder as upsell. Durable, Mixo, Framer are AI builder companies focused on one thing: building great websites. Specialized focus generally beats add-on products. Choose Hostinger for hosting ecosystem. Choose dedicated AI builders for website quality.
