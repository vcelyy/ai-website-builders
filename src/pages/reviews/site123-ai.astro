      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Site123 is the simplest website builder I've tested.</strong> If your goal is to have something online in 5 minutes with zero friction, Site123 delivers.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>The reality:</strong> You get what you pay for. Dated designs, limited features, below-average performance. Mixo and Durable offer more for similar pricing.

        Choose Site123 only if you want absolute simplicity and don't care about design or features.

            Day 1 with Site123: I was impressed.

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Answered 3 questions. Clicked generate. <strong>Site was live in 4 minutes and 37 seconds.</strong>

            <p class="text-sm text-green-900 font-medium">
              I thought: "This is it. The tool for non-technical people. My grandma could use this."
            </p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Then Day 2 happened. I wanted to make simple changes.

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            "Move the logo to the left." Can't do it.

            <p class="text-sm text-red-900 font-medium">
              The site I built in 5 minutes? It was stuck that way forever.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm text-red-900 mt-2">
              I spent the next 5 hours trying to work around Site123's limitations. Eventually gave up and rebuilt on Mixo.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Here's the truth:</strong> "Fast and simple" means "you have no control." If you're okay with whatever Site123 gives you? Great. If you want to make changes? You're trapped.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            I rated Site123 7.1/10. If rating for "speed of initial build," it's a 10/10. For "long-term satisfaction"? It's a 3/10.

    <div class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">The Simplicity Advantage</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Site123's strength is simplicity. You don't drag-and-drop elements. You don't customize layouts. You answer questions, and Site123 builds the site.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        For someone who has never built a website and is intimidated by technology, this is perfect. You'll have a functional site in 5 minutes.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        But that simplicity is also the limitation. Once you want to change something beyond basic text and images, you'll hit a wall.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Better Alternatives Exist</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Mixo AI is also beginner-friendly but offers better templates, AI content generation, and more customization options.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Durable AI has more features including a built-in CRM and AI copywriting tools.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Both cost about the same as Site123 but deliver significantly more value. Site123 only makes sense if you want the absolute simplest option available.
