          "text": "For fine dining establishments, Squarespace is the top choice with elegant presentation, menu display capabilities, reservation integration, and refined aesthetic that matches upscale dining. Mixo provides the best budget option at $9/month for casual restaurants and cafes needing menu display, location information, and contact forms. Durable excels for food trucks wanting fastest setup (30 seconds), location schedules, and social media integration for mobile businesses. Framer serves catering companies needing modern aesthetic (9.5/10), menu showcases, photo galleries, and marketing-focused landing pages. For restaurant websites, prioritize: beautiful food photography, mobile optimization (customers browse on phones), clear menu display with pricing, reservation or online ordering integration, location and hours prominently displayed, social media integration, and customer reviews. Professional food photography and perfect mobile experience are competitive necessities."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "AI website builders are absolutely sufficient for 95% of restaurants. Modern AI builders create professional restaurant websites with menu displays, reservation integrations, online ordering links, photo galleries, and all key features. Third-party integrations with OpenTable, Resy, UberEats, DoorDash, and other restaurant platforms work seamlessly with AI builders. Consider custom development only if you have: complex custom online ordering systems, loyalty programs requiring custom development, multiple locations with complex needs, or substantial budget for differentiation. For independent restaurants, cafes, food trucks, and catering companies, AI builders provide professional results at a fraction of the cost and time of custom development. Your customers care about food quality, atmosphere, and convenience - not website technology. Focus on: stunning food photography, easy menu access, online ordering/reservations, and accurate location information. AI builders handle all of this beautifully."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Most restaurants don't build custom online ordering - they integrate with existing platforms. Easy integration options: Add direct links to UberEats, DoorDash, Grubhub, or your delivery platform of choice. Embed ordering buttons prominently on homepage and menu page. For takeout-focused restaurants, consider Toast POS or Square Online which include ordering systems. Higher-end option: Build custom online ordering with WooCommerce (WordPress) or Shopify, but this requires development investment and ongoing maintenance. Best practice: Start with platform links (UberEats, DoorDash) - they handle delivery, payments, and customer service. Add your own phone number for takeout orders as fallback. As you scale, evaluate if building custom ordering justifies the development cost. For most restaurants: Platform links + prominent phone number = 90% of value at 10% of the cost of custom ordering systems."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Reservation platform integration is straightforward with AI website builders. Most platforms (OpenTable, Resy, Yelp Reservations, SevenRooms) provide embed code - a simple widget you add to your website. Integration process: Sign up for reservation platform, get your embed code or widget link from their dashboard, add to your AI builder website (usually via HTML embed or custom code section), place prominently on homepage and contact page. Alternative: Simple 'Book a Table' button linking directly to your reservation platform page. This requires no technical setup - just a button link. For restaurants just starting: Link-based integration is fastest and works perfectly. For established restaurants: Embedded widget provides seamless experience without leaving your site. Both approaches work - choose based on your technical comfort and how integral reservations are to your business model. Fine dining typically uses embedded widgets. Casual restaurants often use simple links."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Food trucks have different website priorities than brick-and-mortar restaurants. Food trucks need: Current location schedule with days/times/locations, social media integration (Instagram/ Twitter for location updates), quick loading (customers check on mobile while en route), simple menu (limited items, changes frequently), contact for catering inquiries, photos of truck and food. Brick-and-mortar restaurants need: Full menu with descriptions and pricing, reservation system or booking, interior photos and atmosphere, address and parking information, online ordering integration, reviews and social proof, detailed hours and contact info. Best builders for food trucks: Durable (30-second setup, location-focused), Mixo (budget $9/mo, simple). Best for restaurants: Squarespace (elegant for fine dining), Wix (feature-rich for casual), Framer (modern for catering). Food truck websites can be simpler - your customers follow you on location. Restaurant websites need more depth - you're selling the destination experience."

        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "How much should restaurants budget for website photography and design?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Professional food photography is absolutely worth the investment. Based on restaurant website conversion testing: Restaurants with professional food photos see 73% more online orders than those with phone photos. Budget breakdown for professional results: Food photography: $500-2000 for 15-30 professional dishes (includes styling, lighting, editing), Interior photography: $300-800 for atmosphere shots (dining room, bar, patio, exterior), Website builder: $9-65/month depending on platform, Optional: $200-500 for custom design tweaks if you want unique branding. Total first-year budget: $1000-3500 for professional photography + $108-780 for website builder. ROI consideration: If professional photos increase orders by even 5-10%, most restaurants recoup photography investment in 1-3 months. For budget approach: Mixo at $9/month + DIY photography with good lighting and a decent smartphone camera. Upgrade to professional photography when revenue justifies it. Remember: Your website photos are often customers' first impression of your food quality. Professional photos signal professional food."

          <p class="text-gray-700">
            <strong>For fine dining establishments, Squarespace is the top choice</strong> with elegant presentation, menu display capabilities, reservation integration, and refined aesthetic that matches upscale dining. Mixo provides the best budget option at $9/month for casual restaurants and cafes needing menu display, location information, and contact forms. Durable excels for food trucks wanting fastest setup (30 seconds), location schedules, and social media integration for mobile businesses. Framer serves catering companies needing modern aesthetic (9.5/10), menu showcases, photo galleries, and marketing-focused landing pages. For restaurant websites, prioritize: beautiful food photography, mobile optimization (customers browse on phones), clear menu display with pricing, reservation or online ordering integration, location and hours prominently displayed, social media integration, and customer reviews. Professional food photography and perfect mobile experience are competitive necessities.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do restaurants need custom websites or are AI builders sufficient?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            AI website builders are absolutely sufficient for 95% of restaurants. Modern AI builders create professional restaurant websites with menu displays, reservation integrations, online ordering links, photo galleries, and all key features. Third-party integrations with OpenTable, Resy, UberEats, DoorDash, and other restaurant platforms work seamlessly with AI builders. Consider custom development only if you have: complex custom online ordering systems, loyalty programs requiring custom development, multiple locations with complex needs, or substantial budget for differentiation. For independent restaurants, cafes, food trucks, and catering companies, AI builders provide professional results at a fraction of the cost and time of custom development. Your customers care about food quality, atmosphere, and convenience - not website technology. Focus on: stunning food photography, easy menu access, online ordering/reservations, and accurate location information. AI builders handle all of this beautifully.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">What features should restaurant websites include?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Restaurant websites need: (1) Beautiful food photography - your dishes sell themselves visually, (2) Clear menu display with current pricing and descriptions, (3) Location and hours information prominently displayed, (4) Reservation system or booking links for full-service restaurants, (5) Online ordering links for delivery/takeout (UberEats, DoorDash, etc.), (6) Contact information and phone number for orders and inquiries, (7) Interior and atmosphere photos - help customers imagine dining with you, (8) Dietary information - vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free options, (9) Customer reviews or links to review platforms (Yelp, Google), (10) Social media integration - Instagram feed, social links, (11) Special events, promotions, or happy hour information, (12) Mobile-optimized experience - most customers browse on phones. key: professional food photos, current menu, accurate hours, easy online ordering or reservations. Everything should support getting customers to order, book, or visit.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">How do I add online ordering to my restaurant website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Most restaurants don't build custom online ordering - they integrate with existing platforms. Easy integration options: Add direct links to UberEats, DoorDash, Grubhub, or your delivery platform of choice. Embed ordering buttons prominently on homepage and menu page. For takeout-focused restaurants, consider Toast POS or Square Online which include ordering systems. Higher-end option: Build custom online ordering with WooCommerce (WordPress) or Shopify, but this requires development investment and ongoing maintenance. Best practice: Start with platform links (UberEats, DoorDash) - they handle delivery, payments, and customer service. Add your own phone number for takeout orders as fallback. As you scale, evaluate if building custom ordering justifies the development cost. For most restaurants: Platform links + prominent phone number = 90% of value at 10% of the cost of custom ordering systems.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">How do I integrate reservation systems like OpenTable or Resy?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Reservation platform integration is straightforward with AI website builders. Most platforms (OpenTable, Resy, Yelp Reservations, SevenRooms) provide embed code - a simple widget you add to your website. Integration process: Sign up for reservation platform, get your embed code or widget link from their dashboard, add to your AI builder website (usually via HTML embed or custom code section), place prominently on homepage and contact page. Alternative: Simple 'Book a Table' button linking directly to your reservation platform page. This requires no technical setup - just a button link. For restaurants just starting: Link-based integration is fastest and works perfectly. For established restaurants: Embedded widget provides seamless experience without leaving your site. Both approaches work - choose based on your technical comfort and how integral reservations are to your business model. Fine dining typically uses embedded widgets. Casual restaurants often use simple links.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">What's the difference between website builders for food trucks vs restaurants?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Food trucks have different website priorities than brick-and-mortar restaurants. Food trucks need: Current location schedule with days/times/locations, social media integration (Instagram/ Twitter for location updates), quick loading (customers check on mobile while en route), simple menu (limited items, changes frequently), contact for catering inquiries, photos of truck and food. Brick-and-mortar restaurants need: Full menu with descriptions and pricing, reservation system or booking, interior photos and atmosphere, address and parking information, online ordering integration, reviews and social proof, detailed hours and contact info. Best builders for food trucks: Durable (30-second setup, location-focused), Mixo (budget $9/mo, simple). Best for restaurants: Squarespace (elegant for fine dining), Wix (feature-rich for casual), Framer (modern for catering). Food truck websites can be simpler - your customers follow you on location. Restaurant websites need more depth - you're selling the destination experience.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">How much should restaurants budget for website photography and design?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Professional food photography is absolutely worth the investment. Based on restaurant website conversion testing: Restaurants with professional food photos see 73% more online orders than those with phone photos. Budget breakdown for professional results: Food photography: $500-2000 for 15-30 professional dishes (includes styling, lighting, editing), Interior photography: $300-800 for atmosphere shots (dining room, bar, patio, exterior), Website builder: $9-65/month depending on platform, Optional: $200-500 for custom design tweaks if you want unique branding. Total first-year budget: $1000-3500 for professional photography + $108-780 for website builder. ROI consideration: If professional photos increase orders by even 5-10%, most restaurants recoup photography investment in 1-3 months. For budget approach: Mixo at $9/month + DIY photography with good lighting and a decent smartphone camera. Upgrade to professional photography when revenue justifies it. Remember: Your website photos are often customers' first impression of your food quality. Professional photos signal professional food.
