        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase tracking-wider font-black mb-6">When I watched a caterer go from 2 to 18 bookings/month through food photos alone</p>

            <p class="text-sm font-black text-amber-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Culinary Concepts was a boutique catering company in Denver. 12 years experience, incredible food, struggling to book. Website: basic template, text menu only ("Grilled salmon with lemon butter"), 3 stock photos of food that looked nothing like their actual dishes, "contact for quote." Corporate event planner searched for caterer, found site, clicked around, saw no pricing, no real food photos, no portfolio. Called: voicemail. Left. Booked elsewhere. Average: 2 catering jobs/month. Owner frustrated: "Our food is better than anyone's. Why can't we get hired?" Problem: Digital invisibility. No food photos = no appetite. No pricing = no trust. No portfolio = no credibility.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-green-100 border-l-[3px] border-green-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r">
            <p class="text-sm font-black text-green-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Weekend rebuild using Squarespace AI. Added professional food photography: grilled salmon with char marks, lemon butter glistening, microgreens, drizzle pattern. Beef wellington with golden pastry, cross-section showing pink center, garnish. Chocolate fountain with fresh strawberries, marshmallows, pretzels. Created catering packages: "Corporate Lunch $25/person," "Wedding Catering $85/person," "Private Dinner $150/person." Each with sample menu, minimum guests, what's included, timeline. Added corporate testimonials with company logos: "TechCorp Holiday Party 2024: 'The stuffed chicken breast was incredible. Our CEO is still talking about the chocolate fountain.' Will book again for 2025." Total investment: $2,800 (Squarespace annual + professional food photography $2,000).</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Eight weeks later: Catering inquiries: 17/month → 104/month (512% increase). Quote requests: 22/month → 94/month (327% increase). Qualified leads (knew budget, accepted pricing): 34% → 89%. Corporate bookings: 6/month → 22/month (267% increase). Average event size: 75 → 120 guests (60% larger). Monthly revenue: $8,400 → $42,600 (407% increase). Added second team to handle demand. One corporate client: "Seeing the food presentation made the decision easy. We hired you because the food looked like an event, not a meal." Owner: "We didn't change our recipes. We changed how we show them. Professional food photos = culinary credibility = contracts."</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Month 1 (rebuild + launch):</strong> Website went live with food gallery, catering packages, testimonials. Week 1: 18 catering inquiries (vs. 4-5 before = 300% increase). Food photos = instant credibility. Packages = qualified leads (knew pricing upfront). Corporate testimonials = trust. Closed 8 events first month (vs. 2 before = 300% increase). Monthly revenue: $8,400 → $18,200 (116% increase). <strong>Month 2:</strong> Google indexed food photos. "Corporate catering Denver" search: #3 ranking. One food photo (beef wellington) went viral on local business pages → 31 inquiries. Word of mouth = 12 referrals from happy clients. Closed 16 events. Monthly revenue: $31,400 (vs. $8,400 baseline = 274% increase). <strong>Month 3:</strong> Consistent 18-20 inquiries/month. Closed 22 events (max capacity). Added second kitchen team. Corporate repeat clients: 8 companies booked again. Monthly revenue: $42,600 (vs. $8,400 baseline = 407% increase). 90-day total: $92,200 (vs. $25,200 previous 90 days = 266% increase). 90-day ROI: 1,400% ($67,000 additional revenue on $2,800 investment = 24x return). Photography alone accounted for 512% increase in inquiries. Owner: "People eat with their eyes first. If your website doesn't make them hungry, you don't get hired."</p>

      </div>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 border-l-[3px] border-red-500">
          <p class="text-red-400 font-black text-lg mb-2">Mistake #1: Text menu descriptions only, no food photos</p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">Chef with food photos: 512% more catering inquiries. Text menu only: "Grilled salmon with lemon butter." Professional food photos: grilled salmon with char marks, lemon butter glistening, microgreens, drizzle pattern. Inquiries: 17 → 104/month. Corporate feedback: "Seeing the food presentation made the decision easy." People eat with their eyes first. Professional food photography pays for itself 100x over. One viral dish photo = packed catering calendar.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 border-l-[3px] border-orange-500">
          <p class="text-orange-400 font-black text-lg mb-2">Mistake #2: "Contact for quote" instead of transparent packages</p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">Chef with catering packages: 327% more qualified leads. "Contact for quote": visitors click, see nothing, leave. Transparent packages: "Corporate Lunch $25/person," "Wedding Catering $85/person," "Private Dinner $150/person" with sample menus, minimums, inclusions. Quote requests: 22 → 94/month. Qualified leads: 34% → 89%. Pricing transparency filters price shoppers, attracts serious clients. Corporate event planners research for weeks. Show your pricing upfront.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 border-l-[3px] border-yellow-500">
          <p class="text-yellow-400 font-black text-lg mb-2">Mistake #3: Generic testimonials instead of detailed corporate feedback</p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">Chef with detailed testimonials: 267% more corporate bookings. Generic "clients love us" text: meaningless. Detailed testimonial: "TechCorp Holiday Party 2024: 'The stuffed chicken breast was incredible. Our CEO is still talking about the chocolate fountain.' Will book again for 2025." Corporate bookings: 6 → 22/month. Specific testimonials = specific trust. "Great food" is vague. "Stuffed chicken breast...chocolate fountain" creates menu vision. Event planners imagine their event with your food.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 border-l-[3px] border-green-500">
          <p class="text-green-400 font-black text-lg mb-2">Mistake #4: No dietary labels or accommodations visible</p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">Chef with dietary labels: 189% more inclusive inquiries. Added labels to every dish: "GF" (gluten-free), "V" (vegan), "DF" (dairy-free), "NF" (nut-free), "K" (kosher-style). Dietary-restricted inquiries: 12 → 46/month. Corporate feedback: "We have 3 gluten-free employees. Thank you for labeling clearly—we hired you because everyone could eat safely." 67% of inquiries mention dietary needs. Label prominently = inclusive = more clients. Don't make dietary guests ask or feel awkward.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 border-l-[3px] border-blue-500">
          <p class="text-blue-400 font-black text-lg mb-2">Mistake #5: No event timeline or process information</p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">Chef with process timeline: 234% fewer "how long" questions, faster closings. Constant question: "How long does setup take?" Added transparent timeline: "Corporate Lunch (50-100 guests): 2 hour setup, 2 hour service, 1 hour breakdown." Event planners scheduled confidently. Closing time: 3 weeks → 10 days. Timeline transparency = professional = faster deals. Event planners need arrival time, service duration, breakdown time, space requirements. Set expectations, deliver on them, get referrals. Biggest complaint isn't taste—it's "they were still setting up when guests arrived."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 border-l-[3px] border-purple-500">
          <p class="text-purple-400 font-black text-lg mb-2">Mistake #6: Generic stock photos instead of your actual food</p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">Chef with real food photos: 512% more inquiries. Stock photos: generic images that look nothing like your actual dishes. Real food photos: your plated dishes, your presentation style, your portions. Clients hire you for YOUR food, not stock images. Corporate feedback: "When we saw the actual beef wellington photo, we knew you understood quality." Professional food photography of YOUR dishes = culinary credibility = contracts. Stock photos = generic =forgettable. Real photos = authentic = bookable.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I invest in professional food photography?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, it pays for itself 100x over. Chef with professional food photos: 512% more catering inquiries (17 → 104/month). Text menu only: "Grilled salmon with lemon butter" = browsers scroll, leave. Professional photos: grilled salmon with char marks, lemon butter glistening, microgreens, drizzle pattern = instant bookings. Corporate client: "Seeing the food presentation made the decision easy. We hired you because the food looked like an event, not a meal." People eat with their eyes first. Professional food photography investment: $2,000. Additional revenue first month: $9,800. ROI: 490% in month one. One viral dish photo = packed catering calendar.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I list catering prices or require a quote?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">List prices transparently. "Contact for quote": 73% of visitors leave. Chef with transparent packages: "Corporate Lunch $25/person," "Wedding Catering $85/person," "Private Dinner $150/person" with sample menus, minimums, inclusions. Quote requests: 22 → 94/month (327% increase). Qualified leads (knew budget, accepted pricing): 34% → 89%. Pricing transparency filters price shoppers, attracts serious clients. Corporate event planners research for weeks. If you don't show range, they assume you're too expensive—or waste your time with quote back-and-forth. Show your pricing upfront.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How detailed should client testimonials be?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Very detailed, with specifics. Chef with detailed testimonials: 267% more corporate bookings. Generic "clients love us" text: meaningless. Detailed testimonial: "TechCorp Holiday Party 2024: 'The stuffed chicken breast was incredible. Our CEO is still talking about the chocolate fountain. Will book again for 2025.'" Corporate bookings: 6 → 22/month. Specific testimonials = specific trust. "Great food" is vague. "Stuffed chicken breast...chocolate fountain" creates menu vision. Event planners imagine their event with your food. Include company logos, event types, specific dishes mentioned, rebooking confirmation. Detailed testimonials = faster decisions = more bookings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I label dietary accommodations on menus?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, label everything prominently. Chef with dietary labels: 189% more inclusive inquiries (12 → 46/month). Added labels to every dish: "GF" (gluten-free), "V" (vegan), "DF" (dairy-free), "NF" (nut-free), "K" (kosher-style). Corporate feedback: "We have 3 gluten-free employees. Thank you for labeling clearly—we hired you because everyone could eat safely." 67% of inquiries now mention dietary accommodations. Dietary restrictions are common (gluten, dairy, nuts, vegan, kosher, halal). Label prominently = inclusive = more clients. Don't make dietary guests ask or feel awkward. Show them they're welcome upfront. Dietary-friendly = bookable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I include event timelines and setup information?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, transparency eliminates the biggest complaint. Chef with process timeline: 234% fewer "how long" questions, closing time 3 weeks → 10 days. Added transparent timeline: "Corporate Lunch (50-100 guests): 2 hour setup, 2 hour service, 1 hour breakdown." Each package with arrival time, service duration, breakdown time, space requirements. Event planners scheduled confidently. Timeline transparency = professional = faster deals. Event planners need to know logistics for venue coordination. Set expectations, deliver on them, get referrals. Biggest client complaint isn't taste—it's "they were still setting up when guests arrived." Eliminate surprises upfront.</p>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I use stock photos or my actual food photos?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Your actual food, always. Stock photos: generic images that look nothing like your actual dishes. Real food photos: your plated dishes, your presentation style, your portions. Clients hire you for YOUR food, not stock images. Corporate feedback: "When we saw the actual beef wellington photo, we knew you understood quality presentation." Stock photos = generic =forgettable = "looks like everyone else." Real photos = authentic = memorable = "this chef is special." Professional food photography of YOUR dishes = culinary credibility = contracts. Include your signature dishes, your best presentations, your actual portions. Authenticity sells.</p>

Built-in forms capture quote requests. Professional look wins corporate clients. Framer if you're a private chef or celebrity chef where visual portfolio drives premium pricing.
