### Tuesday: Hidden Truth (Framer's Lock-In)

**Tweet:**
```
The ugly truth about Framer AI:

It generates stunning sites in minutes ⚡

But here's what they don't tell you:

❌ Your site looks like 100 other Framer sites
❌ Can't export your code (locked in forever)
❌ Monthly fees add up fast ($15-30/month)
❌ Design customization has limits
❌ No app marketplace for extensions

It's great for: Portfolios, quick MVPs

It's terrible for: Long-term branding, full control

My honest rating: 9.3/10 (with caveats)

After testing 23 tools, the winner is clear:

🏆 FRAMER (9.3/10)

### Thursday: Data Insight (127 Hours = One Insight)

**Tweet:**
```
I spent 127 hours testing AI website builders.

Here's the ONE thing that mattered most:

🎯 DESIGN QUALITY > SPEED

Why?

Because:
- Fast + ugly = visitors leave immediately
- Slow + beautiful = visitors stay (and can wait)
- Most "30-second" builders look generic

The exceptions:
→ Durable (8.5/10) - worth it for MVPs only
→ Framer (9.3/10) - fast AND beautiful

### Friday: Worst Experience (Wix ADI)

**Tweet:**
```
My worst experience testing AI website builders:

Wix ADI (3.2/10)

What happened:
→ Built a site in 5 minutes (great!)
→ Tried to customize (disaster)
→ Design broke when I changed colors
→ Couldn't export the code
→ Support was unhelpful
→ Wasted 6 hours total

The lesson:
"Fast AI generation" often means "zero customization"

## Week 3

### Monday: Tool Comparison (10Web vs Durable)

**Tweet:**
```
10Web vs Durable - WordPress speed or AI speed?

📊 10WEB (8.8/10)
- Best WordPress AI integration
- Generates pages from content
- You own the code
- 70% commission (full disclosure)
- BUT: Learning curve if new to WordPress

⚡ DURABLE (8.5/10)
- 30 seconds to live site
- Cheapest option
- BUT: Limited customization
- BUT: Looks generic
- BUT: Locked into hosting

Quick answer:
→ Use WordPress? 10Web
→ Need MVP fast? Durable
→ Long-term site? 10Web

### Tuesday: Hidden Truth (Durable's Generic Problem)

**Tweet:**
```
The ugly truth about Durable AI:

It generates sites in 30 seconds ⚡

But here's the problem:

Your site looks IDENTICAL to 100 other Durable sites.

❌ Same layouts
❌ Same color schemes
❌ Same sections
❌ Same "AI-generated" feel

Can you customize? Technically, yes.

Is it worth the frustration? No.

Durable is perfect for: Testing ideas quickly

Durable is terrible for: Building a brand

My honest rating: 8.5/10 (for MVPs only)

### Wednesday: Best For WordPress Users

**Tweet:**
```
Best AI website builder if you use WordPress?

After 127 hours of testing: 10Web AI (8.8/10)

Why it wins:
- Seamless WordPress integration
- AI generates pages from your content
- You're not locked in (own your code)
- 70% recurring commission
- Best for existing WordPress sites

Tradeoff: Learning curve if you're new to WordPress

But if you use WordPress? This is your best AI option.

### Thursday: Data Insight (Speed Test Results)

**Tweet:**
```
Speed test results from 127 hours of testing:

Fastest AI website builder:
🏆 Durable - 30 seconds from sign-up to live site

Slowest:
🐌 Wix ADI - 2 hours (and it broke)

The reality:
- Speed matters for MVPs
- Speed doesn't matter for long-term sites
- Most "fast" builders sacrifice customization
- Most "slow" builders give you more control

My recommendation:
→ Test idea? Use fast builder (Durable)
→ Build brand? Use quality builder (Framer/Webflow)

### Friday: Worst Experience (Durable's Design Limits)

**Tweet:**
```
My Durable frustration story:

Built a site in 30 seconds (amazing!)

Then I tried to make it look different:

❌ Can't change section order
❌ Can't customize layouts
❌ Can't add custom components
❌ Can't match my brand colors

I spent 3 hours fighting the designer.

Gave up and rebuilt in Framer.

Lesson: "Fast generation" is worthless if you can't customize.

**Tweet:**
```
Squarespace vs Wix - e-commerce leaders?

🛍️ SQUARESPACE (8.2/10)
- Best e-commerce features
- Professional templates
- Better for online stores
- BUT: Expensive ($23-40/month)
- BUT: Limited export

🎨 WIX (5.1/10 standard, 3.2/10 ADI)
- More template variety
- Cheaper starting price
- BUT: Wix ADI is broken
- BUT: Lock-in is severe

Quick answer:
→ E-commerce? Squarespace
→ Basic site? Neither, use Framer
→ Budget? Neither, use Durable

### Tuesday: Hidden Truth (Wix Export Limits)

**Tweet:**
```
The ugly truth about Wix:

They don't tell you this upfront:

❌ You CAN'T export your code
❌ You CAN'T move your site
❌ You CAN'T use another host
❌ You're locked into Wix pricing forever

Want to leave? Start over from scratch.

This is why Wix invests heavily in "easy to start" - they know you can't leave.

My Wix ADI rating: 3.2/10 (would be lower if possible)

Why:
- Best e-commerce features
- Professional product pages
- Integrated payments
- Inventory management
- Shipping options

Tradeoffs:
- Expensive ($23-40/month)
- Not the fastest builder
- Limited customization

For online stores? Worth it.

For simple sites? Overkill.

### Friday: Worst Experience (Squarespace's Expensive Surprise)

**Tweet:**
```
My Squarespace surprise:

Started testing: "Looks great, $23/month, reasonable"

Connected e-commerce: "Wait, $40/month? Why?"

Hidden costs:
→ E-commerce: +$17/month
→ Transaction fees: 3%
→ No free migration
→ Expensive add-ons

The site is excellent (8.2/10).

The pricing is misleading.

Lesson: Always check e-commerce pricing before committing.

Framer vs Squarespace - portfolios or e-commerce?

🎨 FRAMER (9.3/10)
- Best for portfolios
- Stunning designs
- Fast to build
- Cheaper ($15-30/month)

- BUT: Locked into hosting

🛍️ SQUARESPACE (8.2/10)

### Tuesday: Hidden Truth (Squarespace's Expensive E-commerce)

**Tweet:**
```
The ugly truth about Squarespace e-commerce:

The base price looks reasonable ($23/month).

Then you add e-commerce:

❌ Price jumps to $40/month
❌ 3% transaction fees
❌ Expensive payment processing
❌ No free migrations
❌ Premium features cost extra

Is it worth it? For serious e-commerce, yes.

For small stores? The fees add up fast.

Why:
- 30 seconds to live site
- Perfect for testing ideas
- Cheapest option
- Fast iteration

Tradeoffs:
- Looks generic
- Limited customization
- Not for long-term

My recommendation:
→ Test idea with Durable

### Thursday: Data Insight (The Free Trial Trap)

**Tweet:**
```
The "free trial" trap - data from 127 hours of testing:

What they say:
"Start free, pay when ready"

What actually happens:
→ Free = limited features
→ Free = can't connect domain
→ Free = watermarked/branded
→ Free = export locked

The reality:
- "Free" is a demo, not usable
- Real minimum: $15-30/month
- 12-month cost: $180-360

The lesson:
Budget $15-30/month OR expect limitations.

### Friday: Worst Experience (Webflow's Learning Curve)

**Tweet:**
```
My Webflow learning curve pain:

I knew Webflow was powerful (8.7/10).

I didn't realize HOW steep the learning curve is:

→ 2 hours to build basic page
→ 4 hours to understand interactions
→ 6 hours to figure out CMS
→ Gave up on complex animations

The site is stunning. The learning is brutal.

Webflow is perfect if: You have time to learn

Webflow is terrible if: You need results fast

### Tuesday: Hidden Truth (Webflow's Learning Curve)

**Tweet:**
```
The ugly truth about Webflow:

It's the most powerful AI website builder I tested (8.7/10).

BUT:

❌ Steep learning curve (10+ hours to get good)
❌ Expensive ($20-50/month)
❌ Overkill for simple sites
❌ Complex feature set

Webflow is perfect for:
→ Designers who want full control
→ Complex animations
→ Custom functionality

Webflow is terrible for:
→ Beginners
→ Quick MVPs
→ Simple portfolios

My honest take: Amazing tool, if you have time to learn.

Best AI website builders for code export?

After testing 23 tools, only 5 let you export:

1. Webflow (8.7/10) - Clean HTML/CSS/JS
2. 10Web (8.8/10) - Full WordPress export

Tools that LOCK you in:
❌ Framer - Can't export (biggest drawback)

My lock-in horror story:

Built a site in [AI builder]
Spent weeks customizing
Decided to move to own hosting

Asked to export: "Can't do that"
Asked for code: "Not available"
Asked to migrate: "Start over"

Realized: I was trapped.

This is why I always check export capabilities now.

The worst offenders:
❌ Framer - No export at all
❌ Wix - Impossible to leave
❌ Squarespace - Want to leave? Rebuild

Lesson: Before you build, ask: "Can I export?"

🤖 MIXO (7.8/10)

### Tuesday: Hidden Truth (Why Most AI Builders Fail at Customization)

**Tweet:**
```
The ugly truth: Why most AI builders fail at customization

After 127 hours of testing, I found the problem:

AI builders use templates.

❌ Pre-designed sections
❌ Fixed layouts
❌ Limited color palettes
❌ Rigid structures

Why? Because AI can't (yet) design from scratch.

It remixes existing templates.

The result:
Your site looks like 100 other sites.

The exceptions:
→ Webflow - Full design control
→ Framer - High customization
→ 10Web - WordPress flexibility

Everything else? Template remixing.

My worst customer service experience:

[Tool name] broke during testing.

Reached out to support:
→ 3 days to respond
→ "Can you try clearing cache?"
→ Didn't solve the problem
→ Never heard back again

This happened with: Wix ADI (3.2/10)

Contrast with Framer support:
→ 4 hours to respond
→ Actual solution provided
→ Followed up next day

Good support matters. Bad support wastes hours.

### Tuesday: Hidden Truth (The "AI" Hype)

**Tweet:**
```
The ugly truth about "AI" website builders:

After 127 hours of testing 23 tools, here's what "AI" actually means:

Mostly, it means:
❌ Template remixing (not AI design)
❌ Pre-built sections (not AI generation)
❌ Smart suggestions (not AI creation)

True AI generation exists in:
→ 10Web (generates from content)
→ Durable (generates from prompt)
→ Framer (suggests layouts)

But even these have limits.

The reality:
AI assists, it doesn't replace design.

Yet.

**Tweet:**
```
127 hours of testing = what actually matters:

Things that DON'T matter:
🔴 "AI-generated" marketing
🔴 30-second build time
🔴 Free trial promises
🔴 Template counts

Things that DO matter:
🟢 Design quality (9.3 vs 3.2)
🟢 Can you export? (Critical)
🟢 Monthly cost (12-24 month view)
🟢 Actual customization (not claimed)

The surprise:
Most overhyped features don't impact quality.

Most boring features do.

Focus on: Design quality + Export + Cost

Everything else is noise.

[Tool name]
→ Spent 2 hours building
→ Customized everything
→ Went to publish
→ "Error, site not found"
→ Support: "Can you rebuild?"

Gone. 2 hours wasted.

This happened with: Wix ADI (3.2/10)

The lesson:
Always save your work externally.
Always export frequently.
Always test before investing time.

Tools that auto-save well:
✅ Framer - Version history
✅ Webflow - Reliable backups
✅ 10Web - WordPress autosave
