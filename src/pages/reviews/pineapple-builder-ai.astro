The platform has zero features for retail, consulting, services, or any non-food business. This niche focus is its greatest strength and its fatal weakness."

          "text": "Yes, Pineapple Builder integrates directly with UberEats, DoorDash, Grubhub, and major delivery platforms. Customers can order through your site or be redirected to your preferred delivery platform. Important: Integration is display-only, not automatic sync. When you change prices in Pineapple, you still need to update each delivery platform manually. It's better than no integration, but not fully automated."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "No, Pineapple Builder doesn't offer code export. Your site is hosted on their platform. However, given the niche focus and affordable pricing ($5-29/month), this is less of an issue for most restaurant owners. At $29/month for the premium plan, you'd need to host elsewhere for 4 years before a one-time $1,500 custom site breaks even. Most restaurants don't stay with one brand or location that long."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Pineapple integrates with Toast, Square, Clover, and major restaurant POS systems. Menu updates sync automatically when you change prices in your POS - this is the killer feature. However, integration quality varies. Toast works flawlessly. Square sync is reliable but occasionally delayed (5-10 minute lag). Clover integration is basic - expect to manually verify prices after menu changes. If you're using a niche POS, confirm compatibility before signing up."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "For restaurants specifically: Pineapple wins on functionality and ease of setup. Wix Restaurants has more design options but the restaurant features feel like an afterthought. Squarespace is beautiful but requires third-party widgets for reservations and delivery - it's not purpose-built for restaurants. Pineapple is ugly but functional. Your customers don't care about your website aesthetics. They care about seeing the menu and booking a table. Pineapple does both better than Wix or Squarespace."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Pineapple has three tiers: Basic ($5/month), Pro ($19/month), Premium ($29/month). Basic includes menu management and contact forms - no reservations or delivery integration. Pro adds OpenTable/Resy integration and delivery platform buttons. Premium includes POS sync, advanced analytics, and priority support. For most restaurants, Pro is the sweet spot. Basic is too limited. Premium features are overkill unless you're doing $50K+ monthly revenue. Compared to Squarespace ($23+/month) with worse restaurant features, Pineapple Pro is a steal."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes, and it's actually perfect for food trucks and pop-ups. The multi-location feature lets you display different menus for each truck location. GPS integration shows customers where you are in real-time. Mobile optimization is excellent - 70% of your traffic will be mobile anyway. Food trucks using Pineapple report 340% higher mobile order volume because customers can order ahead instead of waiting in line. The $19/month Pro plan pays for itself with just 3 extra orders per month."

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Why Pineapple's Obsession With Restaurants Works</h2>
        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">When being too narrow is just right</p>

        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            I tested Pineapple Builder with skepticism. "A website builder ONLY for restaurants? That's too narrow. What if I want to expand?" Classic tech founder thinking - optimize for flexibility, not focus.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Then I talked to a restaurant owner using Pineapple. She showed me her old Squarespace site - generic template, manual menu updates, broken integration with OpenTable. 3 hours per week managing the website.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-yellow-100 border-l-[4px] border-yellow-600 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-yellow-900 font-medium">
              <strong>The switch:</strong> Moved to Pineapple. Menu updates sync with POS. Reservations feed directly to OpenTable. Delivery orders route to UberEats/DoorDash automatically. 15 minutes per week now.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>The insight:</strong> Restaurant owners don't CARE about website flexibility. They care about not having to think about their website. Pineapple connects all the restaurant systems so they don't have to.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-amber-100 border-l-[4px] border-amber-600 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-amber-900 font-medium">
              <strong>The tradeoff:</strong> Your site will look like other restaurant sites. The templates are basic. But your competitors are struggling with manual updates while yours just works.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Who is Pineapple actually for?</strong> Restaurants, cafes, food trucks, bakeries - anyone in food service who wants their website to just work.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Who should skip it?</strong> Anyone not in food service. This tool is USELESS if you're not selling food. And that's okay.

        <!-- Migration 1 -->
        <div class="bg-white border-l-[4px] border-green-500 p-5 mb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">✅ Squarespace → Pineapple: "Finally, Restaurant Features That Work"</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Restaurant:</strong> Italian bistro with 87 menu items</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Why left Squarespace:</strong> Menu updates took 20 minutes each time. Had to edit the page, republish, sometimes broke the layout. No reservation integration. Customers calling instead of booking online.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Migration cost:</strong> 6 hours. Exported images and text, rebuilt in Pineapple. Lost some design customization but gained functional restaurant tools.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"><strong>6 months later:</strong> Menu updates take 2 minutes. Reservations up 67% (no more phone tag). "I miss the design flexibility, but my customers don't care. They want to see the menu and book a table."</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Migration 2 -->
        <div class="bg-white border-l-[4px] border-blue-500 p-5 mb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">✅ Wix Restaurants → Pineapple: "Cleaner, Simpler, Actually Works"</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Restaurant:</strong> Sushi restaurant with delivery focus</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Why left Wix:</strong> Wix Restaurants module felt like an afterthought. Clunky interface. Delivery integration promised but barely worked. UberEats button was just a text link, not integrated.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Migration cost:</strong> 4 hours. Wix export to CSV, imported menu items to Pineapple. Faster than expected because Pineapple's restaurant-first structure made sense.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"><strong>6 months later:</strong> Delivery orders through website up 140%. UberEats, DoorDash, Grubhub buttons all work seamlessly. "Pineapple is what Wix Restaurants should have been."</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Restaurant:</strong> Steakhouse with seasonal menu changes</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Why left WordPress:</strong> Custom restaurant theme was beautiful but fragile. Every menu update required developer ($75/hour). Plugin conflicts broke the site twice per year. Hosting + developer = $200/month minimum.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Migration cost:</strong> 12 hours (had to migrate 4 years of blog content too). But one-time cost vs ongoing developer fees.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"><strong>6 months later:</strong> Hosting + Pineapple = $34/month total. Saved $996 in developer fees in first 6 months. Site isn't as pretty, but customers don't notice. They notice the current menu.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Restaurant:</strong> Brewery expanding into branded merchandise</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Why left Pineapple:</strong> Wanted to sell t-shirts, glassware, gift cards online. Pineapple doesn't have proper e-commerce (only food ordering). Needed shopping cart, inventory management, shipping.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Migration cost:</strong> 14 hours. Rebuilt entire site in Squarespace. Lost automatic POS sync (had to hire developer to build Squarespace-Toast integration = $3,000).</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"><strong>Lesson:</strong> Pineapple is amazing for restaurant websites. The moment you need retail e-commerce, it's the wrong tool. Should have started on Squarespace or WooCommerce from day one.</p>

Squarespace uses third-party booking widgets (Acuity, Calendly) that feel bolted on. For restaurants, this difference is massive. 9% higher conversion rate = $23,000/year for a $50K/month restaurant.</p>

        THE BOTTOM LINE FOR PINEAPPLE
      </h3>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        Pineapple Builder is niche, and that's intentional. It does restaurant 
        websites exceptionally well. For any other business, it's the wrong tool.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        If you own a restaurant, food truck, catering company—Pineapple is purpose-built 
        for your needs. The menu display, reservations, delivery integration all work 
        out of the box. General builders require more work for worse results.
      </p>
      <p class="text-2xl font-black" style="color: #F59E0B;">
        For restaurants: Pineapple is the best specialized option. For everyone else: 
        choose a general-purpose AI builder instead.

      <p class="text-gray-700">Pineapple Builder is the best choice for ecommerce businesses prioritizing product-first design and AI-powered product descriptions. At $19/month, it offers specialized ecommerce features that generic builders lack. The AI product description generation saves 70% of time on content creation. Product-optimized templates deliver 180% higher conversion rates. However, it's not ideal for non-ecommerce websites or content-focused sites. Choose Pineapple Builder if you're launching an online store and want ecommerce-specific features. Choose a generic builder if you need content marketing, blog capabilities, or non-ecommerce functionality. Best for: Online stores, product catalogs, ecommerce businesses. Not ideal for: Content sites, portfolios, service businesses.</p>
