Framer costs $15-25/month, 10Web costs $10-60/month. The question isn't which is better—it's what are you building? If you need a portfolio or marketing site with stunning design, choose Framer.

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Framer costs $15-25/month depending on features like code export and analytics. Over 3 years, Framer costs $540-900 total. 10Web costs $10/month for basic sites up to $60/month for enterprise e-commerce with WooCommerce. Over 3 years, 10Web costs $360-2160 depending on plan level. Framer is more predictable with flat pricing. 10Web's pricing scales with your e-commerce needs—small stores pay less, large stores pay more. Framer's free tier is limited for testing. 10Web's free tier exists but requires their hosting. For marketing sites, Framer offers better value. For e-commerce, 10Web's WooCommerce integration justifies the premium pricing."

No product variants, no inventory management, no discount codes, no shipping zones, no cart functionality. If you're selling 1-5 products with fixed pricing, Framer works. But if you need variants (size, color), inventory tracking, coupon codes, or a real shopping cart, Framer cannot handle it. 10Web gives you full WooCommerce—the same e-commerce platform powering 40% of online stores. Real product management, real inventory, real payment processing. If you're serious about e-commerce, 10Web is the only viable choice. If you just need buy buttons on a portfolio, Framer is simpler and faster."

          "text": "Framer is easier for beginners familiar with design tools like Figma or Sketch. The visual editor is intuitive—adjust anything, see results immediately. Learning curve is moderate. 10Web requires understanding WordPress concepts—posts, pages, plugins, themes, WooCommerce settings. If you've never used WordPress, there's a steeper learning curve. However, if you're already in the WordPress ecosystem, 10Web feels natural. For complete beginners: Framer is easier to learn for marketing sites. 10Web is easier if you have WordPress experience or need e-commerce features that exist as plugins. Both have documentation and communities, but Framer's is more focused on design workflows while 10Web's covers the entire WordPress ecosystem."

That's a 20-point difference—Framer loads faster, provides better mobile experience, and ranks better on Core Web Vitals. The performance gap comes from architecture: Framer generates optimized static sites. 10Web uses WordPress which is database-driven with plugin overhead. This matters for SEO, user experience, and conversion rates. If performance is critical (and it should be), Framer is the clear winner. However, if you need e-commerce features that only WooCommerce provides, you may need to accept 10Web's lower performance as the trade-off for functionality."

          "text": "Export options differ significantly. Framer exports React code tied to Framer's dependencies—available only on the $25/month tier. It's not portable code you can just drop anywhere. You'll need a React developer to refactor it for production use. 10Web runs on standard WordPress, so you can export your entire site—database, themes, plugins, content—and migrate to any WordPress host. This is genuine portability. WordPress is an open platform—switch hosts, self-host, hire a developer. You're not locked into 10Web specifically, you're locked into WordPress generally. For true portability, 10Web wins. Framer's export is more for backup than migration. If you plan to switch platforms eventually, 10Web's WordPress foundation gives you more exit options."

Choose 10Web when: You're building a serious e-commerce store; You need WooCommerce features (variants, inventory, discounts); You're already in the WordPress ecosystem; You want access to 60,000+ WordPress plugins; You need to migrate or self-host eventually; You're comfortable with WordPress complexity. Choose neither when: You need maximum performance AND full e-commerce (consider headless), Budget is very tight (both get expensive), You want complete code ownership without platform lock-in, You're building a simple blog (use Ghost or Squarespace). The right tool depends entirely on what you're building—answer that first, then the choice is obvious."

					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Where Framer wins</h2>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Design quality is unmatched</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Framer's AI generates layouts that look professionally designed. Thoughtful spacing. Nice typography. Subtle animations that enhance without distracting. It feels like a human designer spent time on it.
					</p>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						10Web's designs are functional. Generic business templates. Nothing offensive, but nothing memorable either. If your brand is design-driven, Framer is the obvious choice.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Performance is excellent</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						My test sites on each:
					</p>
					<ul class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<li><strong>Framer:</strong> 98/100 mobile, 96/100 desktop</li>
						<li><strong>10Web:</strong> 78/100 mobile, 82/100 desktop</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						That's a 20-point difference. Framer's sites load faster, score better on Google's Core Web Vitals, and provide a better user experience on slow connections.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The editor is actually usable</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Framer's visual editor feels like using Figma. Adjust anything, and it behaves predictably. I created custom hover states, scroll animations, and micro-interactions without fighting the tool.
					</p>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						10Web uses the WordPress editor (Gutenberg) or Elementor. Both work, but they feel clunky compared to Framer. If you're used to design tools, Framer is more intuitive.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Where 10Web wins</h2>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">E-commerce actually works</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						This is the big one. Framer can add a "buy" button, but that's it. No product variants. No inventory management. No discount codes. No shipping zones.
					</p>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						10Web gives you full WooCommerce. That means:
					</p>
					<ul class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<li>Product variations (size, color, etc.)</li>
						<li>Inventory tracking</li>
						<li>Coupon codes and discounts</li>
						<li>Multiple shipping methods</li>
						<li>Tax calculation by region</li>
						<li>Payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						If you're selling products online, 10Web is the only viable option. Framer can't compete here.
					</p>

					<div class="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-6 my-8">
						<p class="text-sm">
							<strong>WooCommerce powers 40% of all online stores.</strong> It's battle-tested, extensible, and widely supported. 10Web gives you all of that with AI generation on top.
						</p>
					</div>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">You can actually export your site</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						10Web runs on WordPress. That means you can export your site and move it anywhere. Want to switch hosts? Export and migrate. Want to self-host? Download the files.
					</p>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Framer's export is locked behind the $25/month tier, and even then, you're exporting React code tied to Framer's ecosystem. It's not portable. 10Web gives you standard WordPress—move it wherever you want.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The plugin ecosystem</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						10Web is WordPress. That means 60,000+ plugins. Need SEO? Install Yoast. Need forms? Install Gravity Forms. Need analytics? Install whatever you want.
					</p>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Framer has integrations, but it's a closed ecosystem. If you need something Framer doesn't provide, you're out of luck. With 10Web, there's probably a plugin for it.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>The lock-in comparison</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Both tools have vendor lock-in, but different flavors:
					</p>
					<ul class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<li><strong>Framer:</strong> Locked into Framer's hosting. Can export (expensive), but exported code requires Framer dependencies.</li>
						<li><strong>10Web:</strong> Locked into WordPress. But WordPress is open source—you can migrate to any host, self-host, or hire someone to maintain it.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						10Web's lock-in is softer. WordPress is a platform, not a product. Framer's lock-in is harder—your site is tied to their proprietary system.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>So which should you use?</h2>

					<ul class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<li>You're building a portfolio or marketing site</li>
						<li>Design quality matters more than flexibility</li>
						<li>You don't need e-commerce (or only need simple "buy" buttons)</li>

						<li>You're comfortable with design tools (Figma, Sketch, etc.)</li>

						<div class="space-y-4">
							<p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A fashion designer friend needed a portfolio plus a small shop. She sells 15 handmade items. That's it. No variants, no inventory tracking—just a "buy this $300 dress" button.</p>
							<p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>On Framer:</strong> Built the portfolio in 4 hours. Stunning image galleries, smooth hover effects, looked like a high-end brand. Added Stripe Buy buttons for the 15 items. Total cost: $17/month. PageSpeed: 96/100.</p>
							<p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>On 10Web:</strong> Built a WooCommerce store. Product pages, cart, checkout flow. Took 12 hours. Looked... fine. Generic store template. PageSpeed: 74/100.</p>
							<div class="bg-cyan-100 border-l-[4px] border-cyan-500 p-4 my-4">
								<p class="text-sm text-cyan-900 font-medium"><strong>The punchline:</strong> She launched the Framer site. 6 months later? $47,000 in sales. The "basic" Stripe buttons worked perfectly. WooCommerce would've been overkill.</p>
							</div>
							<p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Then I tested the opposite scenario:</strong> A client with 300 SKUs, inventory management, discount codes, wholesale pricing. Framer couldn't handle it. 10Web's WooCommerce setup handled everything out of the box.</p>
							<div class="bg-green-100 border-l-[4px] border-green-500 p-4 my-4">
								<p class="text-sm text-green-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Framer for portfolios and marketing sites with simple sales. 10Web for real e-commerce with inventory. Don't let WooCommerce complexity kill a simple project. Don't let Framer's limitations break a complex store.</p>
							</div>
							<p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">I've built production sites on both. Framer feels premium. 10Web feels capable. They're not competitors—they're different tools for different jobs.</p>

							<div class="bg-white border-[2px] border-gray-200 p-6">
								<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Is Framer or 10Web better for website building?</h3>
								<p class="text-gray-700">
									<strong>Framer and 10Web serve different purposes</strong>—Framer (9.5/10 design) wins for portfolios and marketing sites with superior design quality and 98/100 PageSpeed scores. 10Web wins for e-commerce with full WooCommerce support and WordPress plugin ecosystem. Framer costs $15-25/month, 10Web costs $10-60/month. The question isn't which is better—it's <strong>what are you building?</strong> If you need a portfolio or marketing site with stunning design, choose Framer. If you need a serious e-commerce store with inventory, variants, and discounts, choose 10Web. These tools solve different problems.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="bg-white border-[2px] border-gray-200 p-6">
								<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">What is the price difference between Framer and 10Web?</h3>
								<p class="text-gray-700">
									Framer costs $15-25/month depending on features like code export and analytics. Over 3 years, Framer costs $540-900 total. 10Web costs $10/month for basic sites up to $60/month for enterprise e-commerce with WooCommerce. Over 3 years, 10Web costs $360-2160 depending on plan level. Framer is more predictable with flat pricing. 10Web's pricing scales with your e-commerce needs—small stores pay less, large stores pay more. Framer's free tier is limited for testing. 10Web's free tier exists but requires their hosting. For marketing sites, Framer offers better value. For e-commerce, 10Web's WooCommerce integration justifies the premium pricing.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="bg-white border-[2px] border-gray-200 p-6">
								<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Can Framer handle e-commerce or do I need 10Web?</h3>
								<p class="text-gray-700">
									Framer's e-commerce is extremely basic—simple buy buttons via Stripe or Gumroad integration. No product variants, no inventory management, no discount codes, no shipping zones, no cart functionality. If you're selling 1-5 products with fixed pricing, Framer works. But if you need variants (size, color), inventory tracking, coupon codes, or a real shopping cart, Framer cannot handle it. 10Web gives you full WooCommerce—the same e-commerce platform powering 40% of online stores. Real product management, real inventory, real payment processing. If you're serious about e-commerce, 10Web is the only viable choice. If you just need buy buttons on a portfolio, Framer is simpler and faster.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="bg-white border-[2px] border-gray-200 p-6">
								<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Which is better for beginners: Framer or 10Web?</h3>
								<p class="text-gray-700">
									<strong>Framer is easier for beginners</strong> familiar with design tools like Figma or Sketch. The visual editor is intuitive—adjust anything, see results immediately. Learning curve is moderate. 10Web requires understanding WordPress concepts—posts, pages, plugins, themes, WooCommerce settings. If you've never used WordPress, there's a steeper learning curve. However, if you're already in the WordPress ecosystem, 10Web feels natural. For complete beginners: Framer is easier to learn for marketing sites. 10Web is easier if you have WordPress experience or need e-commerce features that exist as plugins. Both have documentation and communities, but Framer's is more focused on design workflows while 10Web's covers the entire WordPress ecosystem.
								</p>

							<div class="bg-white border-[2px] border-gray-200 p-6">
								<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How does the performance compare between Framer and 10Web?</h3>
								<p class="text-gray-700">
									<strong>Framer significantly outperforms 10Web.</strong> Framer test sites score 98/100 mobile, 96/100 desktop on Google PageSpeed. 10Web test sites score 78/100 mobile, 82/100 desktop. That's a 20-point difference—Framer loads faster, provides better mobile experience, and ranks better on Core Web Vitals. The performance gap comes from architecture: Framer generates optimized static sites. 10Web uses WordPress which is database-driven with plugin overhead. This matters for SEO, user experience, and conversion rates. If performance is critical (and it should be), Framer is the clear winner. However, if you need e-commerce features that only WooCommerce provides, you may need to accept 10Web's lower performance as the trade-off for functionality.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="bg-white border-[2px] border-gray-200 p-6">
								<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Can I export my site from Framer or 10Web to move elsewhere?</h3>
								<p class="text-gray-700">
									Export options differ significantly. Framer exports React code tied to Framer's dependencies—available only on the $25/month tier. It's not portable code you can just drop anywhere. You'll need a React developer to refactor it for production use. 10Web runs on standard WordPress, so you can export your entire site—database, themes, plugins, content—and migrate to any WordPress host. This is genuine portability. WordPress is an open platform—switch hosts, self-host, hire a developer. You're not locked into 10Web specifically, you're locked into WordPress generally. For true portability, 10Web wins. Framer's export is more for backup than migration. If you plan to switch platforms eventually, 10Web's WordPress foundation gives you more exit options.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="bg-white border-[2px] border-gray-200 p-6">
								<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">When should I choose Framer over 10Web or vice versa?</h3>
								<p class="text-gray-700">
									<strong>Choose Framer when:</strong> You're building a portfolio, marketing site, or landing page; Design quality is critical for your brand; Performance matters (98/100 PageSpeed); You only need simple buy buttons, not full e-commerce; You're comfortable with design tools like Figma; Budget is $15-25/month flat.<strong>Choose 10Web when:</strong> You're building a serious e-commerce store; You need WooCommerce features (variants, inventory, discounts); You're already in the WordPress ecosystem; You want access to 60,000+ WordPress plugins; You need to migrate or self-host eventually; You're comfortable with WordPress complexity.<strong>Choose neither when:</strong> You need maximum performance AND full e-commerce (consider headless), Budget is very tight (both get expensive), You want complete code ownership without platform lock-in, You're building a simple blog (use Ghost or Squarespace). The right tool depends entirely on what you're building—answer that first, then the choice is obvious.

      BOTTOM LINE
    </h2>
    <p class="text-2xl text-white/90 mb-12">
      Framer and 10Web are the only two AI builders that export code. That's where similarities end. Framer is for designers who want beautiful sites and know React. 10Web is for practical builders who want WordPress speed and affordability. Same feature (code export), completely different audiences.

    <div class="bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-2xl p-8 border-4 border-white/20">
