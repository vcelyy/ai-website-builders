Asked: "So I paid you $4,000 for something I could have done myself?" Had to explain value curation, prompt engineering, revision work. Awkward conversation. AI builders devalue agency work in clients' eyes.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-1">Agency built SaaS site on Wix for $8,000. Six months later, client wants to move to custom development for new features. Asked for source files. Wix: "No export option." Client: "I paid $8K and I don't own my website?" Agency lost the client. Lawsuit threat over deliverables. Wix lock-in almost destroyed agency reputation.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Built SaaS marketing site for startup client on Wix. Used custom design, integrated their CRM, set up analytics. Looked great. Client was thrilled. Paid $8,000 invoice on time. Everyone happy.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Six months later: Client raises Series A, wants to hire in-house developers.

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong class="text-gray-900">The realization:</strong> I checked Wix documentation. Checked forums. contacted support. Same answer everywhere: "No export feature. Sites must stay on Wix."
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Me to client: "Actually, the site lives on Wix. We can't export the source."

        Me: "You own the content, the design, the branding. But it has to stay on Wix."

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong class="text-gray-900">New rule:</strong> Every client site going forward must be exportable.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        That meant:
      </p>
      <ul class="text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>✓ WordPress sites (10Web for AI speed, full ownership)</li>
        <li>✓ Custom code (more work, but clients own everything)</li>
        <li>✓ Framer only with explicit written consent about lock-in</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <strong class="text-gray-900">The conversation:</strong> "We can build this on Framer for $4,000, but you'll need to keep hosting there. Or we build custom for $8,000, and you own everything." Clients choose ownership every time.

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Built next client site with 10Web AI on WordPress. Handed off:

      <ul class="text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>✓ WordPress admin login</li>

        <li>✓ Clear statement: "You own everything"</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <strong class="text-gray-900">The difference:</strong> Client hired in-house developer 8 months later. Site migrated to custom hosting in 2 hours. Agency got thank-you note for "building something we could actually grow with." No threats. No refunds. No reputation damage.

					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#64748B]"></div>Why most AI builders fail agencies</h2>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Vendor lock-in is a dealbreaker</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Framer makes beautiful sites. But you can't export to clean React, you can't give clients the source, and if you stop paying Framer, the site goes down. Try explaining that to a client who just paid you $8,000 for a "custom" website. I've had that conversation. It goes like this: "So I paid for a custom site but I can't have the files?" "Well, technically you own the content but..." It's not fun.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">White-label options are rare</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					10Web is the only one with decent white-label hosting. Durable and Framer both splash their branding everywhere. You can hide some of it, but clients eventually figure it out. Nothing says "premium agency" like a client seeing "Powered by Framer" in their footer and Googling it to find out they could have done it themselves.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Client handoff is awkward</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Agencies build, then hand off. But how do you hand off a Durable site? "Here's the login to this proprietary platform you've never heard of." Clients want WordPress because they know it, or they want code they can host anywhere. Most AI builders don't give you either. I've handed off WordPress sites to hundreds of clients. Never had an issue. Handed off a Framer site once—spent an hour explaining why it was different.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">You can't bill appropriately</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					If a tool builds a site in 30 seconds, what do you charge? Your client knows it didn't take you 40 hours. But they also can't do it themselves. You're selling expertise and curation, not just generation. Most clients don't get that. "So why am I paying you $5,000 when the AI did it?" "Because I knew which prompts to use and I fixed everything it got wrong." That's a hard conversation.

						<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Which AI builder gives clients full ownership of their site?</h3>
						<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
						 <strong class="text-gray-900">Only 10Web WordPress gives true client ownership.</strong> WordPress sites can be exported, moved to different hosting, and handed off with zero platform dependency. Framer sites are locked to Framer hosting—you can't export clean React, you can't give clients the source files. If client ownership matters (and it should), 10Web is the only AI builder that doesn't create lock-in.
                        </p>

					<div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-8">
						<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Can I white-label Framer for client work?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                          <strong class="text-gray-900">Sort of, but clients will figure it out.</strong> You can remove the visible "Made with Framer" badge from the footer. But the page source still contains Framer references. Savvy clients or their developers will notice. Even worse, if a customer sees the badge and Googles "Framer," they'll find out it's $15/month—and question why they paid your agency $4,000+. Framer is the cleanest option, but it's not truly white-label.
                        </p>

						<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How do I hand off an AI-built site to a client?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                          <strong class="text-gray-900">WordPress is the only easy handoff.</strong> Clients know WordPress. Developers know WordPress. Hosting companies support WordPress. Handing off a Framer site requires explaining why they're stuck with this specific platform, can't export, and have to keep paying Framer forever. I've handed off hundreds of WordPress sites—never an issue. Handed off one Framer site—hour-long awkward conversation about lock-in.

						<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should agencies use Relume for client work?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                          <strong class="text-gray-900">Yes, but as a planning tool, not a building tool.</strong> Relume AI generates incredible sitemaps and wireframes in 20 minutes. Use it for client presentations, architecture planning, and getting alignment. Then export those wireframes and build the actual site in Webflow, Framer, React, or whatever gives you the control and ownership your clients need. Relume for planning, not for production.

						<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How do I bill clients when AI builds the site in 30 seconds?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                          <strong class="text-gray-900">Bill for expertise, not time.</strong> Your value isn't in clicking "generate"—it's in knowing what to generate, fixing what AI gets wrong, customizing for their brand, and handling revisions. But this is a hard sell when clients see AI marketing claiming "build your site in 30 seconds." Be transparent: "I use AI tools to speed up the process, but you're paying for strategy, curation, and customization." Some clients still won't get it.
                        </p>

					 <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">What happens when clients want to migrate away from the AI builder?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                          <strong class="text-gray-900">With most AI builders: painful rebuild.</strong> Framer exports to React, but it's messy Framer-specific code—not clean, maintainable React. You're essentially rebuilding from scratch. 10Web WordPress exports cleanly because it's just WordPress. Durable doesn't export at all—rebuild required. If client ownership matters (and it should), avoid platforms that make migration painful or impossible.
                        </p>

					<div class="pb-8">
						<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Is Durable usable for agency work?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                          <strong class="text-gray-900">Not really. It's too limited.</strong> Durable generates simple sites quickly, but you can't customize much beyond templates. Complex agency work requires custom layouts, advanced interactions, integrations—Durable can't handle it. Even for simple sites, the Durable branding is hard to fully remove, and clients will eventually notice. Durable is great for solopreneurs building their own site. Wrong tool for agency client work.
