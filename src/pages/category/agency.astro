					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Why most AI builders fail agencies</h2>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Vendor lock-in is a dealbreaker</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Framer makes beautiful sites. But you can't export to clean React, you can't give clients the source, and if you stop paying Framer, the site goes down. Try explaining that to a client who just paid you $8,000 for a "custom" website. I've had that conversation. It goes like this: "So I paid for a custom site but I can't have the files?" "Well, technically you own the content but..." It's not fun.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">White-label options are rare</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					10Web is the only one with decent white-label hosting. Durable and Framer both splash their branding everywhere. You can hide some of it, but clients eventually figure it out. Nothing says "premium agency" like a client seeing "Powered by Framer" in their footer and Googling it to find out they could have done it themselves.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Client handoff is awkward</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Agencies build, then hand off. But how do you hand off a Durable site? "Here's the login to this proprietary platform you've never heard of." Clients want WordPress because they know it, or they want code they can host anywhere. Most AI builders don't give you either. I've handed off WordPress sites to hundreds of clients. Never had an issue. Handed off a Framer site once—spent an hour explaining why it was different.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">You can't bill appropriately</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					If a tool builds a site in 30 seconds, what do you charge? Your client knows it didn't take you 40 hours. But they also can't do it themselves. You're selling expertise and curation, not just generation. Most clients don't get that. "So why am I paying you $5,000 when the AI did it?" "Because I knew which prompts to use and I fixed everything it got wrong." That's a hard conversation.

					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>The only agency workflow that makes sense</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					After testing everything, here's the workflow that actually works:
				</p>

				<div class="my-8 p-6 bg-gray-100 border-[3px] border-gray-300">
					<p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-4">Relume AI → [Your Builder] → Client</p>
					<ol class="text-sm text-gray-600 space-y-2 list-decimal list-inside">
						<li>Use Relume AI to generate sitemap and wireframes (20 minutes)</li>
						<li>Review with client, get feedback, iterate (1-2 hours)</li>
						<li>Export wireframes to Webflow/Framer/React/whatever</li>
						<li>Build the actual site with full control</li>
						<li>Hand off to client with no platform lock-in</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4 pt-4 border-t border-gray-300">
						Is it faster than letting AI build the whole thing? No. But can you hand it off to a client without an awkward conversation? Yes. That's worth the extra time.
