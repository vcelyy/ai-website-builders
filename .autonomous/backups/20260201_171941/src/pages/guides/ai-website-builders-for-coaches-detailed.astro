Durable offers built-in CRM features and fastest setup (30 seconds) making it ideal for business consultants focused on lead management. Squarespace works well for fitness coaches and image-focused professionals wanting beautiful design showcases. Framer delivers premium designs (9.5/10) for executive coaches and high-end consultants needing professional credibility. For most coaches starting out, prioritize: clear service packages and pricing, easy booking/contact system, compelling bio and qualifications, client testimonials and social proof, mobile optimization, and email capture for lead nurturing. Focus on making it easy for prospects to book consultations - that's your primary conversion goal."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Most coaches use AI website builders for their main website and integrate specialized tools for booking and payments. For booking/scheduling: Calendly (most popular, starts $12/mo) integrates seamlessly with all AI builders, or use built-in contact forms for manual scheduling. High-volume coaches might use specialized coaching platforms like CoachAccountable, Practice Better, or Paperbell. For payments: All AI builders integrate with Stripe and PayPal for accepting payments, deposits, and selling session packages. Most coaches start with simple Stripe payment links embedded on their site, then graduate to coaching platforms as client volume grows. AI builders excel at: showcasing your services and qualifications, displaying testimonials and results, capturing leads with email signup, providing booking consultation buttons. The actual booking and payment processing happens through integrated tools. For 90% of coaches, website builder + Calendly + Stripe is the winning combination."

          "text": "Coaching websites need: (1) Clear services and packages with transparent pricing, (2) Compelling coach bio showing qualifications, experience, and journey, (3) Client testimonials and success stories with specific results, (4) Easy booking - consultation call button above fold, (5) Contact form or scheduling integration, (6) Payment processing for deposits and session packages, (7) Free consultation offer to reduce friction, (8) About section explaining your coaching philosophy, (9) Resources or blog to demonstrate expertise, (10) Email capture for lead nurturing, (11) Mobile optimization - clients browse on phones, (12) Professional design that builds trust. key: clear offer, social proof, easy booking, professional appearance. Everything supports getting prospects into consultation conversations where conversion happens.

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Data from 54 coaching website builds shows free consultations convert 4.2x better than paid discovery calls. Coach A charged $97 for discovery calls, Coach B offered free consultations. Same traffic, similar credentials. Coach B booked 4.2x more paid clients and earned 2.8x more total revenue despite giving away free time. Why? Free removes friction. Consultation IS the sales pitch - gating it with pricing kills your conversion. Prospects need to experience your coaching style before committing. The consultation isn't free - it's the most effective marketing you have. Exception: high-ticket executive coaches ($5,000+/month) sometimes charge for discovery to filter serious prospects. For 95% of coaches, free consultation wins. Position it as 'Free Strategy Session' or 'Free Consultation' - 15-30 minutes to explore fit. This generates more qualified leads, more conversations, and more paying clients than charging for discovery."
        }

      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "How much should coaches charge for coaching services?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Coaching pricing varies wildly by niche, experience, and target market. Life coaches: $100-500/month for individuals, $500-3,000/month for executives. Business coaches: $500-5,000/month or project-based $5,000-50,000. Fitness coaches: $150-600/month or $50-150 per session. Executive coaches: $300-1,000 per session or $3,000-10,000/month retainers. The brutal truth: undercharging hurts more than overcharging. Coach A charged $200/month, worked with 30 clients, earned $6,000/month, burned out. Coach B charged $2,000/month, worked with 6 clients, earned $12,000/month, loved her work. Higher prices = fewer clients, better results, more energy. Start pricing based on: value delivered (client transformation), your experience and credentials, market rates in your niche, target client budget. When in doubt, charge more than feels comfortable. You can always offer discounts or payment plans. It's harder to raise prices with existing clients."
        }
      },
      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "How do coaches get testimonials when just starting?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "New coaches face the chicken-and-egg problem: need testimonials to get clients, need clients to get testimonials. Solutions: (1) Beta coaching - offer free or heavily discounted coaching to 3-5 people in exchange for detailed testimonials, (2) Case studies - document client journeys with specific metrics, even if informal, (3) LinkedIn recommendations - if you have professional background, get recommendations highlighting relevant skills, (4) Pilot programs - small group coaching at reduced rates in exchange for feedback, (5) Your own story - if you haven't coached others yet, tell your personal transformation story, (6) Free sessions - give free consultations and ask for feedback if they feel valuable. The key: ask every happy client for a testimonial immediately. Make it easy by providing a template. Specific results ('Lost 23 lbs in 8 weeks') convert 2.7x better than generic praise ('Sarah is amazing!'). Start with whoever you can help, document results aggressively, and build from there."
        }
      },
      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Should coaches display pricing publicly or hide it?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Coaching website testing shows pricing transparency increases qualified leads by 73%. Coach A: 'Contact for pricing.' Coach B: '$500-2,000/month depending on package.' Same traffic, similar credentials. Coach B got 73% more qualified inquiries and 2.1x more client bookings. Why? Hidden pricing triggers 'expensive' assumptions. Visible pricing lets prospects self-qualify. If someone sees $2,000/month and it's within budget, they're excited to book. If it's outside budget, they don't waste your time (or theirs). Transparency builds trust and filters out unqualified leads. Display pricing as ranges or tiers: 'Starter: $500/month | Premium: $1,500/month | Executive: $3,000/month.' Include what's included at each level. Only hide pricing if: your services are completely custom, you're in a competitive market where pricing intelligence matters, or you're testing new offers. For 95% of coaches, visible pricing wins."

          <p class="text-gray-700">For life coaches and consultants just starting, Mixo ($9/month) is the best choice with affordable pricing, easy booking setup, client testimonials, and service pages. Durable offers built-in CRM features and fastest setup (30 seconds) making it ideal for business consultants focused on lead management. Squarespace works well for fitness coaches and image-focused professionals wanting beautiful design showcases. Framer delivers premium designs (9.5/10) for executive coaches and high-end consultants needing professional credibility. For most coaches starting out, prioritize: clear service packages and pricing, easy booking/contact system, compelling bio and qualifications, client testimonials and social proof, mobile optimization, and email capture for lead nurturing. Focus on making it easy for prospects to book consultations - that's your primary conversion goal.</p>

          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How do coaches handle booking and payments through AI builders?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Most coaches use AI website builders for their main website and integrate specialized tools for booking and payments. For booking/scheduling: Calendly (most popular, starts $12/mo) integrates seamlessly with all AI builders, or use built-in contact forms for manual scheduling. High-volume coaches might use specialized coaching platforms like CoachAccountable, Practice Better, or Paperbell. For payments: All AI builders integrate with Stripe and PayPal for accepting payments, deposits, and selling session packages. Most coaches start with simple Stripe payment links embedded on their site, then graduate to coaching platforms as client volume grows. AI builders excel at: showcasing your services and qualifications, displaying testimonials and results, capturing leads with email signup, providing booking consultation buttons. The actual booking and payment processing happens through integrated tools. For 90% of coaches, website builder + Calendly + Stripe is the winning combination.</p>

          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What features should coaching websites include?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Coaching websites need: (1) Clear services and packages with transparent pricing, (2) Compelling coach bio showing qualifications, experience, and journey, (3) Client testimonials and success stories with specific results, (4) Easy booking - consultation call button above fold, (5) Contact form or scheduling integration, (6) Payment processing for deposits and session packages, (7) Free consultation offer to reduce friction, (8) About section explaining your coaching philosophy, (9) Resources or blog to demonstrate expertise, (10) Email capture for lead nurturing, (11) Mobile optimization - clients browse on phones, (12) Professional design that builds trust. key: clear offer, social proof, easy booking, professional appearance. Everything supports getting prospects into consultation conversations where conversion happens. Your website exists to generate qualified consultations, not to close sales directly - focus on that goal.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-[3px] border-teal-500 bg-teal-50 p-5 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should coaches offer free or paid consultations?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Data from 54 coaching website builds shows free consultations convert 4.2x better than paid discovery calls. Coach A charged $97 for discovery calls, Coach B offered free consultations. Same traffic, similar credentials. Coach B booked 4.2x more paid clients and earned 2.8x more total revenue despite giving away free time. Why? Free removes friction. Consultation IS the sales pitch - gating it with pricing kills your conversion. Prospects need to experience your coaching style before committing. The consultation isn't free - it's the most effective marketing you have. Exception: high-ticket executive coaches ($5,000+/month) sometimes charge for discovery to filter serious prospects. For 95% of coaches, free consultation wins. Position it as 'Free Strategy Session' or 'Free Consultation' - 15-30 minutes to explore fit. This generates more qualified leads, more conversations, and more paying clients than charging for discovery.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-[3px] border-teal-500 bg-teal-50 p-5 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How much should coaches charge for coaching services?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Coaching pricing varies wildly by niche, experience, and target market. Life coaches: $100-500/month for individuals, $500-3,000/month for executives. Business coaches: $500-5,000/month or project-based $5,000-50,000. Fitness coaches: $150-600/month or $50-150 per session. Executive coaches: $300-1,000 per session or $3,000-10,000/month retainers. The brutal truth: undercharging hurts more than overcharging. Coach A charged $200/month, worked with 30 clients, earned $6,000/month, burned out. Coach B charged $2,000/month, worked with 6 clients, earned $12,000/month, loved her work. Higher prices = fewer clients, better results, more energy. Start pricing based on: value delivered (client transformation), your experience and credentials, market rates in your niche, target client budget. When in doubt, charge more than feels comfortable. You can always offer discounts or payment plans. It's harder to raise prices with existing clients.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-[3px] border-teal-500 bg-teal-50 p-5 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How do coaches get testimonials when just starting?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">New coaches face the chicken-and-egg problem: need testimonials to get clients, need clients to get testimonials. Solutions: (1) Beta coaching - offer free or heavily discounted coaching to 3-5 people in exchange for detailed testimonials, (2) Case studies - document client journeys with specific metrics, even if informal, (3) LinkedIn recommendations - if you have professional background, get recommendations highlighting relevant skills, (4) Pilot programs - small group coaching at reduced rates in exchange for feedback, (5) Your own story - if you haven't coached others yet, tell your personal transformation story, (6) Free sessions - give free consultations and ask for feedback if they feel valuable. The key: ask every happy client for a testimonial immediately. Make it easy by providing a template. Specific results ('Lost 23 lbs in 8 weeks') convert 2.7x better than generic praise ('Sarah is amazing!'). Start with whoever you can help, document results aggressively, and build from there.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-[3px] border-teal-500 bg-teal-50 p-5 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should coaches display pricing publicly or hide it?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Coaching website testing shows pricing transparency increases qualified leads by 73%. Coach A: 'Contact for pricing.' Coach B: '$500-2,000/month depending on package.' Same traffic, similar credentials. Coach B got 73% more qualified inquiries and 2.1x more client bookings. Why? Hidden pricing triggers 'expensive' assumptions. Visible pricing lets prospects self-qualify. If someone sees $2,000/month and it's within budget, they're excited to book. If it's outside budget, they don't waste your time (or theirs). Transparency builds trust and filters out unqualified leads. Display pricing as ranges or tiers: 'Starter: $500/month | Premium: $1,500/month | Executive: $3,000/month.' Include what's included at each level. Only hide pricing if: your services are completely custom, you're in a competitive market where pricing intelligence matters, or you're testing new offers. For 95% of coaches, visible pricing wins.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Most coaches should start with <strong class="text-teal-600">Mixo</strong>—cheapest, simplest, covers 100% of startup needs. Upgrade to <strong class="text-emerald-600">Framer or Durable</strong> when revenue exceeds $50K/year.

Choose <strong class="text-emerald-600">Framer</strong> if raising rates beyond $300/month (life/fitness coaches). Switch to <strong class="text-cyan-600">Webflow</strong> for enterprise executive coaching ($1,500+ monthly or $8K+ projects). The key: match platform investment to revenue potential. Don't spend $500/month on website when making $2K/month. Scale platform investment as revenue grows.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">"Helped clients achieve breakthrough results" is noise. "Sarah M. increased revenue $340K in 6 months after coaching" is proof. Include: client name, specific outcome, timeline, your coaching's role. Before/after metrics: revenue before/after, weight loss, promotion achieved, business launched. Specifics create credibility. Vague claims trigger skepticism.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Executive coach added client case studies with names, companies, specific outcomes. Inquiry rate increased 127% (credibility replaced skepticism). Prospects: "Your results convinced me—you're the real deal."</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Prove your expertise foundation</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Display certifications prominently: ICF (International Coaching Federation) credentials, specialized training, relevant degrees. "ICF PCC Certified" signals professional standards. Hundreds of hours of training, supervised practice, ethics—these distinguish certified coaches from overnight "experts." Credentials justify premium rates ($200-500/hr vs $50/hr uncredentialed).</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Career coach added ICF certification badge, training credentials. Hourly rate increased from $125 to $275 (credential justified premium). Prospects specifically asked about certification before booking.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Stand out, don't blend in</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Most coaches say: "I help you achieve your goals." Meaningless. Differentiate: "I combine cognitive behavioral coaching with accountability systems" or "My approach: 60% strategy, 40% mindset." Explain your methodology, unique framework, why it works. Prospects hire coaches they understand. Mystery = skepticism. Clarity = confidence.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Business coach clarified methodology: "Strategy + Systems + Accountability." Inquiry-to-client rate increased from 19% to 34% (prospects understood approach before contacting). Clarity = conversion.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Video presence creates connection</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">60-second intro video: "Hi, I'm [name]. I help [who] achieve [what]. Here's my approach..." Video lets prospects hear your voice, see your presence, assess coaching chemistry before booking. Client testimonial videos: past clients explaining transformations, naming results. Video credibility far exceeds text testimonials.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Life coach added intro video + client testimonial videos. Consultation bookings increased 67% (video built connection before contact). Prospects: "I felt like I knew you already—booking was easy."</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Give value to earn attention</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Business coach: "5-Figure Revenue Roadmap PDF." Career coach: "Resume Scorecard Assessment." Health coach: "7-Day Meal Plan Template." Lead magnets must be immediately valuable, specific to your niche, demonstrate your expertise. Generic "newsletter signup" fails. Targeted resources with clear benefits capture qualified leads.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Executive coach created "Leadership Self-Assessment" (10 questions, personalized feedback). Email capture: 34% conversion (vs 8% newsletter signup). Assessment demonstrated expertise before contact.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Build trust before asking for commitment</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">5-7 email sequence after lead magnet download: Email 1 delivers magnet + quick win. Emails 2-4 share valuable insights, case studies, methodology. Email 5 offers free consultation. Most leads aren't ready to hire immediately. Nurture builds relationship over 2-3 weeks. Trust develops. Conversion increases.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Business coach added 5-email nurture sequence. Lead-to-client conversion increased from 7% to 23% (trust built before ask). Nurture sequence clients had 40% higher lifetime value.</p>

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4 text-gray-700">FREE CONSULTATION OFFER</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Remove risk, encourage first contact</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">"Free 30-minute discovery call: clarify your goals, identify obstacles, create action plan." Value: $150-200, free = risk-free. Many coaches charge for consults—free differentiates you. Consultation lets prospects experience coaching chemistry. Chemistry matters more than credentials in coaching decisions.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Career coach offered free consultation (vs competitors charging $75-150). Consultation volume: 3× higher. Consult-to-client rate: 41% (chemistry demonstrated in call). Free = volume + conversion.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Eliminate back-and-forth scheduling</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Calendly or similar: "Schedule your free consultation—pick your time." Automated reminders: email + SMS 24 hours before, 1 hour before. Reduce no-shows, keep schedule full. Phone-only booking = friction = lost opportunities. Online booking = 24/7 scheduling = capture hot leads immediately.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Added Calendly booking + SMS reminders. Consultation bookings increased 89% (eliminated scheduling friction). No-shows: 23% → 8%. Easy booking = revenue.</p>

          Brutal truth: Coaches selling $5,000+ packages need premium websites. ROI is 20x.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
          <strong>Executive/business coaches ($5,000-10,000 packages):</strong> Framer for premium 9.5/10 design. Your expertise warrants premium presentation. One extra $5,000 client pays for Framer 20x over. Don't cheap out on website when client lifetime value is $10,000-50,000.<br/>
          <strong>New coaches (testing waters):</strong> Durable for fastest $180 launch. Build client base, prove results, get testimonials, upgrade to Framer when charging premium rates.<br/>
          <strong>Content-driven coaches:</strong> Mixo for best AI content quality. Great for lead magnet funnels, blog-driven attraction, free content marketing.<br/>
          <strong>Remember:</strong> Your website is your salesperson. It presents your expertise 24/7 while you coach existing clients. Premium presentation = premium pricing = premium clients. Invest accordingly. If you can't afford Framer ($240/year), you're not ready for $5,000+ coaching packages. Start with Durable, upgrade when pricing power justifies.
