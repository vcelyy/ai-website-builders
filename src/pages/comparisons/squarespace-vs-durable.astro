    <!-- My Experience -->

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">My Experience: The Emergency That Needed Durable</h2>
        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A pest control company needed a site. Emergency service. Storm season was starting in 3 days. They couldn't wait weeks for a designer or hours for template browsing.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Durable:</strong> Generated in 29 seconds. "24/7 Emergency Pest Control" headline. Prominent phone number. Services page. Before/after gallery placeholder. Contact form with emergency checkbox. Built-in CRM captured leads with automatic follow-up reminders. Total time: 14 minutes. Published same day. First emergency call came next day.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Squarespace:</strong> Would've taken 2-4 hours minimum—choose template, customize, add content, set up forms. Days before feeling ready to publish. The design would've been more polished. But during those 3 days of storm season? They'd have lost emergency calls.</p>
          <div class="bg-amber-100 border-l-[4px] border-amber-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-amber-900 font-medium"><strong>3 months later:</strong> Durable site generated 247 leads. 34 became emergency clients. Average job value: $340. $11,560 in revenue from emergency calls they'd have missed while "perfecting" a Squarespace site.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The owner's take: "Could Squarespace look better? Sure. Would it be worth $11,560 in lost emergency revenue? No. Speed isn't a luxury when you're emergency services."</p>
          <div class="bg-orange-100 border-l-[4px] border-orange-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-orange-900 font-medium"><strong>The counterpoint:</strong> A high-end wedding photographer. Visuals ARE the product. Couples browse websites and book based on aesthetic quality. She spent 3 weeks crafting her Squarespace site. Every image, every font, every spacing choice intentional. Result? 47 bookings in year one, average $4,500 per wedding. $211,500 in revenue.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">If she'd used Durable? Generic design would've hurt her brand. Brides wouldn't trust their big day to someone with a template site. The 3-week investment in Squarespace paid for itself 20x over.</p>
          <div class="bg-red-100 border-l-[4px] border-red-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-red-900 font-medium"><strong>The truth:</strong> Durable for functional sites where speed matters more than aesthetics. Pest control, plumbers, emergency services—get online fast. Squarespace for design-led businesses where visual quality directly impacts sales. Photographers, restaurants, boutiques—invest in aesthetics. The pest control company made $11,560 from speed. The photographer made $211,500 from beauty. Both chose the right tool for their business.</p>

      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-orange-500"></div>The fundamental difference
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Squarespace and Durable solve completely different problems. Squarespace exists for people who care deeply about design aesthetics. Durable exists for people who need a website immediately.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      <strong>Squarespace:</strong> Choose from 100+ professionally designed templates. Customize colors, fonts, images. The design quality is consistently high—everything looks polished and professional. But you're working within someone else's vision.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      <strong>Durable:</strong> Type your business name and industry. AI generates a complete site in 30 seconds. Headlines, sections, images—all created for you. The design won't win awards, but it's functional and fast.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-orange-500"></div>Design quality: Squarespace wins
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      This isn't close. Squarespace templates are designed by professionals who understand typography, spacing, visual hierarchy. Every template looks like it could win a design award.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Durable sites look like what they are: AI-generated in 30 seconds. Clean enough, functional, but generic. You'll recognize a Durable site when you see one—same layout patterns, same stock photos, same "template" feel.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      For a wedding photographer or high-end restaurant? Squarespace's design quality directly impacts bookings. For a plumber or pest control service? No one cares if the site has perfect typography. They just need the phone number.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-orange-500"></div>Speed: Durable wins
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Durable generates a complete site in under 30 seconds. You can publish the same day with minimal edits. It's the fastest way to get online.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Squarespace takes hours. Choose a template (30 minutes), add your content (2-4 hours), customize colors and fonts (1-2 hours), set up pages and forms (1 hour). Total: 4-8 hours minimum before publishing. More if you're picky about details.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      The pest control company from my experience needed a site in 3 days before storm season. Durable got them online in 14 minutes. Squarespace would've taken 4 hours—still doable in one day, but Durable was instantaneous.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-orange-500"></div>E-commerce: Squarespace wins
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Squarespace has proper e-commerce built in. Product variants, inventory tracking, shipping zones, tax calculation, abandoned cart recovery. It's a real online store platform.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Durable has basic product pages and Stripe integration. You can sell things. But no inventory tracking, no variants (sizes/colors), no shipping zones. Fine for selling 3-5 products. Not viable for 50+ products with variants.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Jewelry boutique with 120 products? Squarespace. Handyman selling 3 service packages? Durable works.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-orange-500"></div>Blogging: Squarespace wins
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Squarespace has excellent blogging built in. RSS feeds, categories, tags, author profiles, scheduled posts, comments. The blog editor is clean and powerful.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Durable has basic blogging. You can publish posts. But no RSS feeds (critical for 2024), limited categorization, weak comment system. If blogging is core to your strategy, Durable will feel limiting.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-orange-500"></div>CRM and lead management: Durable wins
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Durable includes a built-in CRM. Contact form submissions go into a lead pipeline. Automatic follow-up reminders. Email drip campaigns. It's genuinely useful for small businesses.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Squarespace has forms. That's it. Form submissions go to your email. No CRM, no lead pipeline, no automated follow-ups. You'll need external tools (HubSpot, Mailchimp) for lead management.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      For the pest control company, Durable's CRM captured 247 leads with automatic follow-ups. Squarespace would've just sent form submissions to email. They'd need to build or buy a CRM separately.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-orange-500"></div>Customization: Squarespace wins
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Squarespace lets you customize almost everything. Colors, fonts, spacing, layouts. You can make the template feel like your own. The design system is flexible enough to create unique sites.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Durable limits customization. You can change text, images, colors. But the layout structure? Fixed. Want a different hero section arrangement? Too bad. You're working with what the AI generated.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      For the wedding photographer, this mattered. She spent 3 weeks customizing every detail of her Squarespace site. On Durable? She'd be stuck with a generic layout that couldn't reflect her brand.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-orange-500"></div>Pricing comparison
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      <strong>Squarespace:</strong> $23-65/month depending on plan. E-commerce costs more. No free plan (14-day trial only). Pricing adds up quickly for features like analytics and commerce.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      <strong>Durable:</strong> $12-30/month. Free plan available with Durable branding. More affordable for small businesses. The CRM is included at all levels—no upsell required.
