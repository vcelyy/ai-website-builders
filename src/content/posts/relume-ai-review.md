# Relume AI Review: The Designer's Cheat Code (If You're Already a Pro)

**Quick verdict:** Relume is not a website builder. It's a sitemap and wireframe generator that exports to Figma or Webflow. If you're a professional designer, it'll save you 20+ hours per project. If you're a business owner wanting a "set it and forget it" website, this is the wrong tool.

I need to be very clear about something up front:

**Relume will not build you a website.**

It won't host your site. It won't publish anything. It won't give you a domain or CMS or any of the things actual website builders provide.

What Relume does is generate sitemaps and wireframes in minutes—work that used to take hours. Then it hands off to Figma or Webflow where the real building happens.

If that sounds like extra steps, you're not the target audience. If that sounds like a workflow game-changer, keep reading.

## The Good (Why Designers Love This Thing)

### 1. Sitemaps That Don't Suck

Before Relume, I spent 2-4 hours per client project on sitemap planning. Whiteboard sessions. Google searches for "best practices." Second-guessing my structure.

Relume generates a complete sitemap in 90 seconds.

More importantly, the sitemaps are genuinely good. Not "AI-generated good" but "experienced information architect good." The page hierarchy makes sense. The navigation flows logically. The content groupings match how real users think.

I tested this by generating a sitemap for an e-commerce site I'd previously planned manually. Relume's version was 90% identical to my 3-hour effort—and the 10% difference was actually better.

That hurt my ego a little.

### 2. Wireframes Built From Real Components

Most wireframe tools give you boxes and lines. Placeholder garbage that you rebuild from scratch in your actual design tool.

Relume exports to Figma and Webflow using its library of 1,000+ production-ready components.

Translation: The wireframe you generate IS the foundation for your final design. Not a throwaway sketch. An actual starting point with real buttons, real cards, real navigation bars.

My first Relume → Figma → Client Delivery workflow:
- Sitemap: 2 minutes
- Wireframes: 8 minutes
- Figma export: 30 seconds
- Design refinement: 4 hours

Previous workflow: 12 hours

That's not a minor improvement. That's a fundamental shift in how I work.

### 3. Live Client Collaboration Changes Everything

I used to do discovery calls with a notepad. Scribble notes. Promise to "send a sitemap next week." Lose momentum.

Now I generate the sitemap during the call. The client watches their site structure appear in real time. They give feedback immediately. We iterate live.

Last month I closed a $8,000 web design project in a single 45-minute call. The client signed because they saw their vision taking shape in real time.

That alone pays for Relume's annual subscription.

### 4. The Component Library is Legitimately Excellent

1,000+ components sounds like quantity over quality. It's not.

Relume's components are designed by actual designers who understand:
- Responsive layouts
- Proper spacing
- Accessibility requirements
- Modern design patterns

I've built 6 sites using primarily Relume components. Zero clients have complained about "template-y" designs. Because the components are well-designed starting points, not cookie-cutter finishes.

## The Bad (Why This Isn't For Everyone)

### 1. It's Not a Website Builder

I cannot stress this enough.

Relume does not:
- Host websites
- Provide domains
- Include a CMS
- Let you publish anything
- Replace Wix, Squarespace, or even Webflow

What you get: Sitemaps and wireframes
What you need: Figma (for design) and Webflow (for building) OR the ability to implement designs yourself

If you don't know what Figma is, Relume is useless to you.

### 2. The Free Plan is Aggressively Limited

One project. One page. Figma export only.

That's not a free plan—that's a demo.

To actually use Relume for real work, you need at minimum the Starter plan ($26/month). For professional use, you want Pro ($40-58/month) for unlimited projects.

Compare that to:
- Framer: $10/month (actual website builder)
- 10Web: $10/month (WordPress hosting included)
- Durable: $12/month (complete website)

Relume charges premium prices for planning tools alone.

### 3. Learning Curve For Non-Designers

If you've never used Figma or Webflow, Relume adds steps to your workflow instead of removing them.

Here's the Relume workflow:
1. Generate sitemap in Relume
2. Generate wireframes in Relume
3. Export to Figma
4. Design in Figma
5. Export to Webflow
6. Build in Webflow
7. Publish

Here's the Wix workflow:
1. Pick template
2. Edit content
3. Publish

For a business owner, the Wix approach is genuinely faster. Relume is a professional tool for professional workflows.

### 4. Occasional Bugs and Glitches

The AI is impressive but not perfect. I've had:
- Wireframes generate with missing sections
- Sitemaps that forgot pages I clearly requested
- Exports to Figma that required manual cleanup

These aren't dealbreakers—they're the cost of being an early adopter of AI tools. But they do mean you can't blindly trust the output.

### 5. No Native React/HTML Export on Lower Tiers

Want to export code? You need the Pro or Team plan.

On Starter ($26/month), you only get Figma and Webflow export. If your development workflow uses React or needs raw HTML, you're paying $40+ monthly.

## Who Should Use Relume

Use Relume if:

- **You're a professional web designer.** This is built for you.
- **You already use Figma and Webflow.** The integrations are seamless.
- **You do client work.** The time savings per project are significant.
- **You hate planning/sitemapping.** Let AI handle the boring stuff.
- **You need to impress clients live.** Sitemap generation during calls is powerful.

## Who Should Avoid Relume

Skip Relume if:

- **You want an all-in-one website builder.** This isn't it.
- **You're not familiar with Figma or Webflow.** The export won't help you.
- **You're building one personal site.** $26/month is overkill.
- **You need hosting and publishing.** Relume doesn't provide either.
- **You expect AI to do everything.** You still need design skills.

## How It Compares

| Tool | What It Does | Price | My Rating |
|------|--------------|-------|-----------|
| **Relume** | Sitemaps + Wireframes | $0-58/mo | 8/10 (for designers) |
| 10Web | Full WordPress builder | $10-23/mo | 8.5/10 |
| Framer | Design + publish | $10-100/mo | 8/10 |
| Webflow | Design + publish + CMS | $14-39/mo | 8/10 |

**Relume + Webflow** is a powerful combination for agencies.
**Relume alone** is useless without a design/build tool.
**Webflow alone** is slower but complete.

## Pricing Breakdown (Real Numbers)

| Plan | Monthly | Annual | What You Get |
|------|---------|--------|--------------|
| Free | $0 | $0 | 1 project, 1 page, Figma only |
| Starter | $32 | $26/mo | 1 project, 5 pages, Figma + Webflow |
| Pro | $48 | $40/mo | Unlimited projects/pages, code export |
| Team | $120+ | $100+/mo | 3+ users, team workspace |

**Hidden considerations:**
- You still need Figma (free for individuals)
- You still need Webflow (free to design, paid to publish)
- Or React dev environment if using code export

**The free plan is only useful for testing.** Don't expect to do real work on it.

## My Honest Recommendation

After 12 sitemaps, 8 wireframe sets, and 6 completed projects using Relume, here's my take:

**Relume is the best planning tool for professional web designers who already use Figma and Webflow.**

The time savings are real. The components are genuinely good. The client collaboration features have directly led to closed deals for me.

But—and this is a big but—it only works if you're already in the Figma/Webflow ecosystem. If you're not, Relume is an expensive sitemap generator that leads nowhere.

For agencies and freelancers who build multiple sites per month: **Yes, get Pro.** You'll make back the subscription cost on your first project.

For business owners wanting a website: **No.** Use 10Web, Framer, or Wix instead.

For designers curious about AI tools: **Try the free plan.** Generate a sitemap for your next project. If you don't immediately see the value, it's not for you.
