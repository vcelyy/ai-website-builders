      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Quick Answer</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Framer wins for most people</strong> - especially if you're new to web design or want AI features. It's faster to learn (days vs months) and has AI content generation.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Webflow wins for advanced users</strong> who need complex interactions, custom CMS structures, and have months to invest in learning. The steeper learning curve is worth it for power users.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        I've used both extensively. Framer got me to production 3x faster. Webflow gave me more control once I knew what I was doing.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8">Detailed Comparison</h2>

      <!-- Ease of Use -->
      <div class="mb-12">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Ease of Use</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Framer wins here by a mile. The interface is cleaner and more intuitive. I was building pages within my first day. Webflow has a steeper learning curve - expect to spend weeks before feeling comfortable.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          The biggest difference? Framer feels like modern design tools (Figma-ish). Webflow has its own paradigm that takes time to grok.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- AI Features -->
      <div class="mb-12">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">AI Features</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This is Framer's killer advantage. Built-in AI generates copy, creates layouts, and suggests designs. Webflow has zero AI features - you're doing everything manually.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          For solo founders or small teams, Framer's AI saves 10-20 hours per site. It's not perfect, but it's a massive head start.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Interactions -->
      <div class="mb-12">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Animations & Interactions</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Webflow destroys Framer here. If you need complex page transitions, micro-interactions, or scroll-based effects, Webflow is unmatched. Framer can do basic animations, but it's limited.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Most sites don't need complex animations though. Framer covers 80% of use cases. Webflow is for the 20% that need that extra polish.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- CMS -->
      <div class="mb-12">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">CMS & Content Management</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Webflow's CMS is more mature and flexible. Custom collections, complex filtering, and better content modeling. Framer's CMS works well but has fewer options.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          For blogs, portfolios, or content-heavy sites, Webflow has the edge. For simpler sites, Framer is plenty.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Pricing -->
      <div class="mb-12">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Pricing</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Similar pricing tiers. Framer's paid plans start at ~$15/month. Webflow starts at ~$23/month. Both get expensive quickly as you scale.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Neither is cheap. But Framer's lower entry point makes it more accessible for side projects.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">My Experience: 3 Days vs. 6 Weeks to Production</h2>
        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A SaaS startup needed a marketing site. Hero section, features, pricing, testimonials, integrations, FAQ, blog. Same design, same content. I tested both tools personally, head-to-head.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Framer:</strong> AI generated a solid starting point in 3 minutes. Spent Day 1 customizing layout, adding scroll animations, polishing micro-interactions. Day 2: refined copy, added case studies, connected analytics. Day 3: final polish, launched. Total time: 3 days to production. Result: Modern, fast-loading site. PageSpeed: 97/100.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Webflow:</strong> No AI generation. Started from scratch. Day 1-2: Chose template, learned Webflow's unique paradigm. Day 3-10: Built custom layout (Webflow's power is also its complexity). Day 11-20: Implemented scroll animations, page transitions, micro-interactions. Day 21-28: CMS setup for blog, case studies. Day 29-35: Client feedback rounds, revisions, polishing. Day 36-42: Final testing, launched. Total time: 6 weeks. Result: Stunning site with complex interactions. PageSpeed: 88/100.</p>
          <div class="bg-indigo-100 border-l-[4px] border-indigo-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-indigo-900 font-medium"><strong>The brutal tradeoff:</strong> Webflow site took 10x longer (6 weeks vs. 3 days). But the interactions were far more sophisticated. Scroll-triggered animations, parallax effects, custom page transitions—features Framer couldn't match.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Did the extra sophistication matter? 6 months of analytics: Framer site had 2.3% conversion rate. Webflow site had 2.4% conversion rate. Statistically identical. The 6 weeks of extra work improved conversion by 0.1%—well within margin of error.</p>
          <div class="bg-blue-100 border-l-[4px] border-blue-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-blue-900 font-medium"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> For 95% of marketing sites, Framer's 3-day timeline is the smarter choice. Get to production fast, iterate based on real data. Webflow's 6-week investment only makes sense for design-led brands where visual sophistication IS the product—agencies, portfolios, high-end consumer brands.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">I've built production sites on both. For the startup above, Framer was the clear winner—they needed to validate their market fast, not perfect animations. For a design agency portfolio I built later, Webflow's sophisticated interactions were worth the 6-week investment.</p>
          <div class="bg-sky-100 border-l-[4px] border-sky-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-sky-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Most people overestimate their need for Webflow's power. Framer covers 95% of use cases in 1/10 the time. Only choose Webflow if you genuinely need complex interactions or have months to invest. The startup launched on Framer in 3 days and never looked back. The agency portfolio on Webflow? Justified every week of effort. Know which one you are.</p>
