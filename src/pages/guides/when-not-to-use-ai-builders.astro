              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-1">AI builders cost $9-25/month. Custom dev costs $5,000 upfront. Sounds like AI wins. But after 3 years, you've paid $900 for the AI builder and still don't own anything. Custom dev: you own it day one. The math only works if your project is temporary or you absolutely can't afford upfront.</p>

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-1">You describe "modern coffee shop site." AI picks from 50 coffee shop templates. That's not AI generation—that's template selection with extra steps. You're not getting something unique; you're getting a pre-made design with AI-written copy.</p>

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-1">Framer exports React code. Great, except you need a React developer to deploy it. Mixo exports a zip file of HTML/CSS that's impossible to maintain. "Code export" markets to developers, but the only people using AI builders are non-developers. Catch-22.</p>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-6 bg-white">
          <p class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">When should I avoid using AI website builders?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Avoid AI builders when you need complex functionality (user accounts, dashboards, custom workflows), are building a long-term business asset (5+ years), have development resources available, need portability for client work, operate in highly regulated industries (fintech, healthcare, legal), or require granular SEO control. In these scenarios, AI builders create more problems than they solve.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-6 bg-white">
          <p class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Are AI website builders good for long-term projects?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            No. AI builders are risky for long-term projects. You face pricing changes, platform shutdowns, feature removals, and zero portability. If your site is critical to your business for 5+ years, build on WordPress or custom development. AI builders are great for MVPs and temporary sites, terrible for permanent business assets.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-6 bg-white">
          <p class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can AI builders handle complex applications?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            No. AI builders cannot handle customer dashboards, user authentication, custom workflows, database integrations, or anything beyond basic brochure functionality. You'll hit platform limitations immediately. Use proper frameworks (Next.js, Django, Rails) or no-code tools like Bubble for complex apps.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-6 bg-white">
          <p class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Should agencies use AI builders for client work?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Generally no. AI builders create lock-in—clients can't take their site when they leave you. They're stuck rebuilding from scratch. Use WordPress, Webflow, or custom development for client work. Platforms that export clean code or use standard formats let clients migrate elsewhere, which is what ethical agencies provide.

          <p class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">What's the hybrid approach to AI builders?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            The smart hybrid approach: Phase 1 - Use AI builders to launch fast (Framer for marketing, 10Web for e-commerce). Phase 2 - Get users, test assumptions, validate. Phase 3 - If product works, rebuild custom for scale. If not, you lost little. Ship fast with AI tools, rebuild properly if validation succeeds.

          <p class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do AI builders have good SEO capabilities?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Basic SEO, yes. Advanced SEO, no. AI builders struggle with schema markup at scale, dynamic meta tags, programmatic SEO pages, complex sitemap hierarchies, and technical SEO control. If SEO is critical to your strategy, use WordPress with SEO plugins (Yoast, RankMath) or custom development.

            Hidden costs include: free tier limitations (custom domain $9/mo, remove branding $9/mo, contact form $9/mo), migration costs ($3,000+ to rebuild elsewhere), platform lock-in (can't export, rebuild from scratch), and feature limitations that force upgrades. What looks cheap ($9-25/mo) becomes expensive when you hit walls.

          <span class="font-bold">Problem:</span> AI builders have basic CMS. Collections,

          <span class="font-bold">Problem:</span> Most AI builders lack native e-commerce.
          Framer requires Shopify integration (store elsewhere). Durable has basic
          product pages (not full store). Mixo links to Gumroad. For serious e-commerce
          (inventory management, variants, subscriptions, checkout), AI builders are
          insufficient.

        AI website builders excel at marketing sites, portfolios, and landing pages. They're
        fast, affordable, and produce stunning results. But they have limits. Complex content
        models, serious e-commerce, custom functionality, and enterprise workflows require
        traditional platforms.

        <span class="font-bold">Use AI builders when:</span> Marketing site, portfolio, or
        landing page is primary need. Simple CMS suffices (blog, basic content). No custom

        <span class="font-bold">Avoid AI builders when:</span> Complex content models (magazines,
