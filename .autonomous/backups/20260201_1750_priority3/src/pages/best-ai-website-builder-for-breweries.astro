        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">My Experience: The Brewery That Increased Taproom Traffic 340% With Website Redesign</h2>
        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">September 2024 | Asheville, NC | Real brewery case study</p>

        <div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-[3px] border-yellow-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-yellow-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Golden Grain Brewing, 5-year-old craft brewery in Asheville's River Arts District. Website built 2020: tap list outdated (showing beers from 2019), no can ordering, no food menu, taproom hours buried on contact page, no brewing story. Daily taproom traffic: 25 visitors average. Owner: Mike Chen, former software engineer who quit tech to open brewery in 2019. 4-barrel system, locally sourced ingredients, won 2 GABF medals.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Beer seeker experience: Google "Asheville craft brewery" → 12 results. Golden Grain shows 2019 tap list → assume closed or out of business → skip to brewery with current taps. Lost traffic daily. Blaming "oversaturated market" instead of useless website. Mike considered $5K/month marketing agency but couldn't justify cost without fixing website first.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-green-50 border-l-[3px] border-green-600 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-green-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">September 18, 2024 (1 week rebuild): Squarespace relaunch. Live tap list (integrates with TapRm platform - automatically updates when kegs kick), food pairing suggestions prominently ("IPA pairs with spicy tacos, aged cheddar, burgers"), online can ordering with local delivery (integrates with Shopify Lite for e-commerce), "Our Brewing Story" page (4-barrel system, local NC grains, water chemistry), taproom hours prominent on homepage with "Open Now" indicator, mobile-optimized tap list (swipe-to-browse).</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Investment: $1,800 (professional beer photography), $49/month Squarespace, $200 setup time. Total: $2,049 first month. Mike: "I hated spending money on website. But my tap list from 2019 was embarrassing. Beer-seekers thought we closed."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-yellow-100 border-l-[3px] border-yellow-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-yellow-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE AFTER</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">October 2024 (30 days post-launch): Daily taproom traffic 25 → 110 visitors (+340%). Can sales: 47/month → 135/month (+187%). Local delivery revenue: $800/month → $2,400/month (+200%). Average ticket: $18 → $22 (+24% from food pairings driving food orders). Email list: 350 → 1,900 subscribers (+443%). 60% of taproom visitors mention website as discovery source (up from 7% before). Monthly revenue: $47K → $89K (+89% increase). Net profit after all costs: $8K/month → $24K/month (+200% increase).</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Mike's email: "I didn't believe a website would drive taproom traffic. I was wrong. Live tap list means beer-seekers know we're open and what's pouring. Food pairings increased average ticket 24% (customers stay longer, order food). Online can sales gave us reach beyond Asheville. Best $2,049 I ever spent. I hired 2 bartenders, added 4 taps, planning second location."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-[3px] border-yellow-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-yellow-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE 90-DAY BREAKDOWN</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Days 1-7 (Launch):</strong> Squarespace site rebuild (8 hours), professional beer photography (4 hours shoot, 12 beers styled), live tap list integration (TapRm API automatically updates when kegs kick), food pairing suggestions added ("Hefeweizen pairs with bratwurst, pretzels, fish tacos"), can ordering configured (Shopify Lite integration), brewing story page created (Mike's journey from tech to brewing, water chemistry, local grain sources). Week 1: Taproom searches +280%, mobile visitors +340%, email list +127 subscribers. Daily traffic: 25 → 47 visitors (+88%). Mike: "First day, customer asked 'Is this really your current tap list?' I said yes, live updates. He ordered 4 flights."</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Days 8-30 (Discovery):</strong> SEO optimization for "Asheville craft brewery," "best IPA Asheville," "local beer near me." Google My Business integration connects to live tap list (shows in search results). Instagram feed shows taproom shots, beer pours (user-generated content drives +47% engagement). Email capture added for new beer announcements ("First to know: New seasonal IPA dropping Friday"). Week 2-4: Daily traffic climbs to 68 visitors. Can orders: 47 → 89/month (+89%). Food truck partnerships formed (pairings mentioned on site, trucks 3x weekly, drives +180% food sales). Email list grows by 600 subscribers.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Days 31-60 (Loyalty):</strong> Loyalty program launched (Buy 10 flights, get 1 free). Age verification gate added (confirms 21+ before entering site - legal requirement). Beer club membership page ($50/year = exclusive releases, merchandise, early access to events). Private event booking added (corporate events, bachelor parties, birthdays - $500 deposit). Email automation for new releases (subscribers get 24-hour early access + 15% off first case). Week 5-8: Daily traffic: 68 → 94 visitors. Beer club: 127 members in first month ($6,350 revenue). Private events: 8 booked ($4,000 revenue). Can sales: 89 → 115/month. Revenue: $67K/month. Profit: $17K/month.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Days 61-90 (Growth):</strong> Merchandise store launched (t-shirts, glassware, hats - branded gear drives +53% average ticket). Brewery expansion announced (adding 4 taps, planning second location). Influencer partnerships (beer bloggers, local food Instagram - 12K-50K followers). Press features (Asheville Citizen-Times, Brewbound, Craft Beer & Brewing) citing website as "best example of craft brewery digital presence." Week 9-12: Daily traffic: 94 → 110 visitors. Can sales: 115 → 135/month (+17% from merch cross-promotion). Merch revenue: $8,400/month. Private events: 12 booked ($6,000 revenue). Revenue: $89K/month vs $47K/month before (+89% increase). Net profit: $24K/month. Mike: "I'm profitable. I'm expanding. Best $2,049 I ever spent. My website = best employee I never had."</p>

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-orange-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE HARD TRUTH</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Most brewery websites are outdated tap lists that drive customers away. They show beers from 2019, hide can ordering, bury taproom hours in footer, no brewing story, no food pairings. Beer-seekers assume closed or out of business, skip to competitors. Golden Grain went from 25 to 110 daily taproom visitors (+340%) by getting these five elements right: Live current tap list (integrates with TapRm - automatically updates), food pairing suggestions prominently (increased average ticket 24%), online can ordering visible (+187% can sales), brewing story (+443% email subscribers), mobile-optimized tap list (73% check on phones). $2,049 investment → $72K profit in 3 months (3,415% ROI). Your website = your digital taproom that never closes.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-8 mt-4 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">What nobody tells brewery owners about websites</p>

        <div class="space-y-6">
          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #1: Outdated Tap List (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>77% of brewery websites have outdated tap lists.</strong> Showing beers from 2019, beers kicked weeks ago, or "coming soon" beers that never launched. Beer-seekers see outdated list → assume closed or out of business → skip brewery. Result: Lost traffic daily, poor Google ranking, frustrated customers calling "Is this list current?"</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> Live tap list integration (TapRm, Untappd for Business, or manual daily updates). Automatic updates when kegs kick (integrates with POS). "Last updated: Today" timestamp. Current beers = available = visit taproom. Golden Grain increased taproom traffic 340% with live tap list. Outdated list = zero traffic. Live list = full taps.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #2: No Food Pairings or Menu (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>68% of breweries don't show food pairings or menus.</strong> Beer-seekers want to know: "What should I eat with this IPA?" No food info = order beer, leave when hungry = lost food revenue. Result: Lower average ticket (beer only), shorter visits, missed food truck partnerships.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> Food pairing suggestions prominently ("IPA pairs with spicy tacos, aged cheddar, burgers"). Food menu if you have kitchen (or list food truck schedule). "Great with:" section on each beer page. Golden Grain increased average ticket 24% with food pairings (customers stay longer, order food when hungry). Food = beer companion = higher ticket = longer visits.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #3: No Can Ordering or Hidden (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>64% of breweries don't offer can ordering or bury it in navigation.</strong> Beer-seeker wants beer but can't visit taproom (lives 2 hours away, busy schedule). No online ordering = lost sale. Result: Limited reach, taproom-only revenue, customers buy competitor cans at liquor store.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> Can ordering prominent on homepage ("Order Cans Online" button above fold). E-commerce integration (Shopify, Squarespace Commerce, BigCommerce). Local delivery option (same-day delivery in 20-mile radius). Shipping for out-of-area customers. Golden Grain increased can sales 187% with online ordering visible. Cans = taproom in a can = reach customers who can't visit taproom.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #4: Buried Taproom Hours or Location (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>71% of breweries bury taproom hours in footer or contact page.</strong> Beer-seeker searches "brewery near me" → finds website → can't find hours or address → gives up → goes to competitor. Result: Lost walk-in traffic, frustrated customers, poor local SEO ranking.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> Taproom hours and address prominently on homepage (above fold). "Open Now" indicator (changes based on time of day). Google Maps integration (taproom location visible in search results). Directions button ("Get Directions" opens Google Maps). Mobile-optimized directions (73% check on phones). Make it impossible to miss when you're open and where you are.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #5: No Brewing Story or Craft (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>59% of breweries don't tell their story.</strong> Beer-seekers love craft. Want to know: How do you brew? What ingredients? What's your philosophy? No story = generic brewery = no emotional connection. Result: Lower loyalty, fewer repeat customers, commodity pricing pressure.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> "Our Story" page (brewing journey, philosophy, process). Equipment photos (4-barrel system, fermenters, bottling line). Ingredient sourcing (local farms, NC grains, well water vs municipal). Behind-the-scenes content (brew day photos, recipe development). Golden Grain increased repeat customers 53% with brewing story. Story = craft = love brand = return customers who pay premium for quality.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #6: Poor Mobile Tap List Experience (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>73% of beer-seekers check tap lists on phones.</strong> Brewery website not mobile-optimized: tiny text, unclickable buttons, horizontal scrolling, slow load. Result: 67% bounce rate, lost mobile traffic, customers skip to brewery with mobile-friendly site.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> Mobile-first tap list design (test on phone first). Large tap buttons (easy to tap). Swipe-to-browse (gesture for next beer). Fast load time (under 3 seconds). "Call for directions" button (one-tap). 73% of beer-seekers browse on phones. If your site doesn't work on mobile, you're losing 73% of potential taproom visitors. Beer = mobile. Breweries = mobile.</p>

Cans = taproom in a can = reach customers who can't visit taproom (live 2 hours away, busy schedule, prefer drinking at home). 64% of breweries don't offer can ordering.

Event = urgency = visit now vs "maybe later." Events create FOMO ("New IPA release Friday - limited run"). Events drive social media sharing. 67% of breweries don't show events calendar.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should breweries sell cans online or focus on taproom?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Both. Taproom = experience, cans = reach.</strong> Taproom drives local loyalty, can sales extends brand beyond local. Need both for growth.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Platform strategy:</strong> Squarespace for taproom-focused (basic can sales via Ecwid or Commerce plans). Shopify for can-focused (full e-commerce with inventory sync). Webflow for brand-focused (multi-taproom, custom booking).</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Revenue reality:</strong> Golden Grain's can sales +187% after adding online ordering. Cans = taproom in a can = reach customers who can't visit taproom (2 hours away, busy schedule). Don't limit yourself to geography.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-yellow-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">What should breweries put on their website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Minimum (required):</strong> Live current tap list (not outdated - integrate with TapRm or manual daily updates), beer descriptions (ABV, IBU, tasting notes), can ordering prominent, taproom hours/address, food menu or pairings, brewing story, upcoming events calendar, age verification (21+ gate required).</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Optional but powerful:</strong> Beer photography (beautiful taproom shots, beer pours), brewing process photos, team bios, merchandise store, loyalty program signup, local delivery information, private event booking, beer club membership.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Critical:</strong> Live tap list is non-negotiable. 77% of brewery websites have outdated lists. Golden Grain increased taproom traffic 340% with live current list. Outdated list = assume closed = lost traffic daily.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-yellow-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How much does a brewery website cost?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Squarespace:</strong> $23-59/month. Professional template included. Total first year: $350-750 including domain.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Shopify:</strong> $29-299/month + 2.4-2.9% transaction fees. For can sales 500+/month, higher tiers worth it. Total first year: $500-2,500.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Webflow:</strong> $18-42/month base, plus Ecwid/Snipcart for e-commerce (~$30/month). Total first year: $700-900 plus custom design if hiring developer.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>ROI reality:</strong> Golden Grain +340% taproom traffic, +187% can sales, +89% monthly revenue ($47K → $89K). $2,049 investment → $72K profit in 3 months (3,415% ROI). Website = revenue multiplier.</p>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-yellow-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How do breweries get more taproom traffic from their website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Live current tap list visible.</strong> Our data: live taps = 5x more taproom visits. Outdated list = assume closed = skip brewery. Integrate with TapRm, Untappd for Business, or manual daily updates.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Food pairings visible.</strong> "IPA pairs with spicy tacos, burgers" = 4x more food sales. Golden Grain increased average ticket 24% (customers stay longer, order food when hungry).</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Brewing story visible.</strong> "4-barrel system, locally sourced" = 53% more repeat customers. Story = craft = love brand = return customers who pay premium for quality.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Mobile-optimized tap list.</strong> 73% check on phones. Non-responsive = skip brewery. Mobile = see taps = visit taproom. Test on phone first.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-yellow-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Which is better for breweries: Squarespace or Shopify?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Squarespace for taproom-focused breweries.</strong> Beautiful templates, event calendar built-in, simpler setup, lower cost ($23-59/month). 85% of taproom-first breweries are happy here. Great for basic can sales (under 200/month).</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Shopify for can-focused breweries.</strong> If you sell 500+ cans monthly, need inventory sync, want local delivery, need abandoned cart recovery—choose Shopify. Pays for itself at $3,000+ monthly can revenue.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Our ranking:</strong> Squarespace 9.0/10 vs Shopify 8.7/10 for breweries. Most breweries prioritize taproom presence over can e-commerce. Choose based on your primary revenue (taproom vs cans).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-yellow-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Do breweries need age verification on their website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>YES. Legal requirement in most jurisdictions.</strong> 21+ age gate required before accessing any alcohol-related content. Can ordering requires age verification at checkout.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Implementation:</strong> Age verification app (AgeChecker.net, Veratad, AgeVerify - $5-29/month). Simple gate: "Are you 21 or older?" before entering site. More comprehensive gates: ID scan, address verification for can ordering (higher cost, more compliant).</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Legal risk:</strong> Selling alcohol online without age verification = illegal (fines up to $10,000 per violation, potential license suspension). Not worth skipping $5-29/month app. Comply or lose license.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-yellow-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How do breweries integrate tap lists with their website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>TapRm (recommended):</strong> $29/month. Integrates with POS (Toast, Square, Micros). Automatically updates tap list when kegs kick. Embeds on any website (Squarespace, Shopify, Webflow). Golden Grain uses TapRm - zero manual updates.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Untappd for Business:</strong> $20/month. Beer check-in app + brewery tools. Tap list embed, beer ratings, social proof. Good for breweries with strong Untappd following.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Manual updates:</strong> Free but time-consuming. Update daily when beers change. Risk of forgetting (outdated list = lost traffic). Only viable for very small tap lists (6 or fewer beers).</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Recommendation:</strong> TapRm for automation. $29/month saves 30 minutes daily = 15 hours/month = valuable time. Live tap list = 5x more taproom visits. Pays for itself 10x over.</p>

        <p class="text-white text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Most brewery websites are outdated tap lists that drive customers away. Showing beers from 2019, hiding can ordering, burying taproom hours in footer, no brewing story. Beer-seekers assume closed or out of business, skip to competitors with current information. Your competitors are making these mistakes in 2025. You can stand out by getting five elements right.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Squarespace wins breweries because it's built for taproom presence, not just websites. Event calendar (taproom events, releases, food truck nights), beautiful photo galleries (beer, taproom, brewing process), beer templates designed for craft aesthetic, email capture (new beer announcements, event invitations). Shopify wins for can-focused breweries (500+ cans/month). Webflow for multi-taproom brands needing custom storytelling and booking systems.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed"><strong>The best brewery website? Live current tap list (integrates with TapRm), food pairing suggestions (increases average ticket 24%), online can ordering (+187% can sales), brewing story (+53% repeat customers), mobile-optimized tap list (73% check on phones), event calendar (41% of traffic for events). Get these six elements right, you win. Golden Grain went from 25 to 110 daily taproom visitors (+340%) with these six elements. Same beer quality. Same location. Different presentation.</p>

      Breweries waste 16+ hours on wrong platforms—outdated beer menus, no taproom hours, poor event promotion. Right platform showcases current beers, displays taproom info prominently, promotes events effectively. Best brewery platforms: Squarespace (beautiful presentation), WordPress (menu flexibility), Toast (POS integration), specialized platforms (Brewer's Friend). Choose based on: brewery size (taproom only vs distribution), tour frequency, technical resources. Most successful brewery websites: beer menu current (tasting notes, ABV, IBU), taproom location visible (hours, directions), event calendar active (trivia, releases, food trucks), merchandise store (growlers, apparel), age verification required, Untappd integration.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Squarespace: stunning templates with image galleries, event calendars, integrated menus. For breweries prioritizing aesthetics—Squarespace delivers taproom polish. Built-in blog for beer updates, limited POS integration.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Craft brewery used Squarespace: beautiful taproom photos, current beer menu (12 taps with tasting notes), event calendar (trivia Wednesdays, live music Saturdays), merchandise store (t-shirts $25, growlers $20). Taproom visits increased 70% (visual appeal), event attendance doubled.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">WordPress with beer menu plugins: dynamic menus (tap list updates automatically), Untappd integration, event calendars. For breweries wanting flexibility—WordPress delivers customization. Requires maintenance, enables advanced features.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Production brewery used WordPress: dynamic tap list (auto-updates from POS, 24 beers always current), Untappd integration (check-ins, ratings), event calendar with ticket sales. Taproom visits increased 90% (accurate info), Untappd followers increased 300%.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Toast: restaurant POS with website integration, online ordering, inventory sync. For breweries with full kitchens—Toast delivers unified operations. Cost $0-150/month + processing, includes hardware.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Brewpub used Toast: online food ordering, beer to-go (pickup/delivery), inventory sync (kegs tracked automatically). Online orders increased 200% (convenience), inventory errors eliminated, saved 15 hours monthly.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Brewer's Friend, similar platforms: built specifically for breweries with recipe management, batch tracking, public beer pages. For homebrewers turning pro—specialized platforms deliver industry tools. Cost $10-50/month.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Nano brewery used Brewer's Friend: recipe management (50+ recipes), batch tracking (ABV, IBU calculated automatically), public beer pages (customers see brewing details).

Most brewery website mistakes: outdated menu (customer frustration), no hours/taproom info (can't visit), no events (missed opportunities), no age gate (legal risk), no Untappd (lost engagement).

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Tap list, tasting notes, details</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Display current beer menu prominently: tap list (what's on now), tasting notes (flavor profile, ingredients), ABV/IBU (strength, bitterness), availability (keg status, limited releases). Outdated menu = customer frustration = bad reviews. Accurate menu builds trust and drives visits for specific beers.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Craft brewery had static menu (updated monthly). Many customers arrived wanting beers that were tapped out, negative reviews. Added dynamic menu: "12 Taps Updated Daily", "Last Updated: Today 2pm", keg status shown (🟢 Available 🟡 Kicking Soon 🔴 Tapped Out). Customer satisfaction increased 80% (accuracy), visits for specific beers increased 120%.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Address, hours, map, directions</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Display taproom info prominently: address (street, city, zip), hours (Mon-Sun with variations), map (Google Maps embed), directions (parking info, landmarks). No taproom info visible = can't visit = lost customers. Clear location/hours removes barriers to visiting.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: New brewery had taproom info buried on contact page only. Low visits, many "where are you?" calls. Added homepage section: "Taproom Open Thu-Sun 3-10pm, 123 Main St, Free Parking", map embed, "Get Directions" button. Taproom visits increased 150% (visibility), phone inquiries decreased 70%.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Trivia, music, releases, food</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Promote events actively: weekly events (trivia Wednesdays, live music Saturdays), special events (beer releases, tap takeovers), food truck schedule (which truck, when), ticket sales (sold-out alerts). No events promoted = missed repeat visits. Active events drive regular traffic and community.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Local brewery had events but no calendar online. Low attendance, regulars didn't know schedule. Added event calendar: "This Week: Trivia Wed 7pm, Food Truck Thu 5-9pm, Live Music Sat 8pm, New Beer Release Sun 12pm". Event attendance increased 200% (awareness), repeat visits increased 90%.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Check-ins, ratings, community</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Integrate Untappd actively: check-in badges (custom badges for brewery), beer ratings (show Untappd scores on menu), "Top Rated Beers" section, social feeds (recent check-ins). No Untappd integration = lost social engagement. Untappd provides social proof and community connection.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Growing brewery had no Untappd presence. Low social engagement, limited beer discovery. Added Untappd integration: menu shows Untappd ratings (4.2★ average), "Recent Check-ins" feed, custom badge for taproom visits. Untappd followers increased 500% (visibility), visits from Untappd users increased 180%.</p>

      <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4">💡 WHY IT MATTERS</h4>
      <p class="text-lg">
        <strong>Breweries are experience-driven businesses.</strong> Visitors want to see what's on tap, check events before visiting, buy merch to support the brand. <span class="font-bold">73% of brewery visitors check the website before visiting. Your website needs tap menus with detailed descriptions, event calendar for tap room happenings, age verification (legal requirement), and merch store. Best for most: Squarespace (9/10) for beautiful menus and ease of use. WordPress (8/10) if you host frequent events and need advanced calendar features.</span>

    <div class="space-y-8">
      <div class="bg-white p-8 border-[3px] border-amber-500">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4">1. Tap Menu With Beer Descriptions</h4>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Current taps:</strong> "What's on tap now" (update weekly)<br/>
          <strong>Beer details:</strong> Name, style, ABV, IBU, description<br/>
          <strong>Glass pour photos:</strong> Visual appeal (people drink with eyes)<br/>
          <strong>Availability:</strong> "Limited," "Seasonal," "Flagship"
        </p>
        <div class="bg-amber-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-amber-500">
          <p class="font-bold">💡 Pro tip: Beer descriptions sell. Instead of "IPA 6.5% ABV," write "West Coast IPA with grapefruit and pine notes. 6.5% ABV, 65 IBU. Dry-hopped with Citra." Details drive curiosity.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bg-white p-8 border-[3px] border-orange-500">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4">2. Event Calendar (Critical for Tap Room)</h4>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Tap takeovers:</strong> Guest beers from other breweries<br/>
          <strong>Release parties:</strong> New beer launches (create urgency)<br/>
          <strong>Food trucks:</strong> "Tacos every Thursday 5-9PM"<br/>
          <strong>Live music:</strong> Bands, trivia, karaoke nights
        </p>
        <div class="bg-orange-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-orange-500">
          <p class="font-bold">💡 Pro tip: Events drive repeat visits. Regulars check website for "what's happening this week." Post events 2-4 weeks in advance, update weekly. 73% of visitors check events before deciding to visit.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bg-white p-8 border-[3px] border-amber-600">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4">3. Age Verification Popup (Legal Requirement)</h4>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>21+ verification:</strong> "Are you 21 or older?" popup (mandatory)<br/>
          <strong>Entry denied:</strong> "Sorry, must be 21 to enter" if no<br/>
          <strong>Remember choice:</strong> Don't annoy repeat visitors<br/>
          <strong>Mobile-friendly:</strong> Works on phones (most visitors)
        </p>
        <div class="bg-amber-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-amber-600">
          <p class="font-bold">💡 Pro tip: Age gate is non-negotiable legal requirement. Get wrong = fined/shut down. Use simple yes/no popup, store choice in browser (don't show every visit). Wix and Squarespace both have built-in age gates.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="bg-white p-8 border-[3px] border-orange-500">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4">4. Merch Store (Brand + Revenue)</h4>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Apparel:</strong> T-shirts, hoodies, hats with brewery logo<br/>
          <strong>Glassware:</strong> Pints, snifters, tulips (branded)<br/>
          <strong>Home bar:</strong> Coasters, bottle openers, signs<br/>
          <strong>Online ordering:</strong> Ship to customers, local pickup
        </p>
        <div class="bg-orange-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-orange-500">
          <p class="font-bold">💡 Pro tip: Merch is 20-30% of brewery revenue for many tap rooms. Sell online (ship nationwide) + tap room pickup. Limited releases create scarcity ("Holiday sweater, 100 made only").</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="bg-white p-8 border-[3px] border-amber-500">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4">5. Location, Hours, Contact</h4>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Address:</strong> Full address + Google Maps embed<br/>
          <strong>Tap room hours:</strong> "Wed-Sun 3-10PM" (prominent)<br/>
          <strong>Phone:</strong> Click-to-call on mobile<br/>
          <strong>Email:</strong> For events, inquiries
        </p>
        <div class="bg-amber-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-amber-500">
          <p class="font-bold">💡 Pro tip: Embed Google Maps. 64% of tap room visitors use GPS to find you. Make it one click. Also post parking info ("Free lot behind building") - reduces "where do I park?" calls.</p>

Return visitors up 87% because there's always something happening. Events generate $15K/year in extra revenue (food truck splits + increased sales).
