Here's what actually happened.</p>

Wix delivered fastest setup (launched in 3 hours). Framer got 67% more portfolio engagement with before/after sliders. Each platform serves different contracting business models.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Apex Builders, general contractor in Phoenix suburbs. 15 years in business. Quality craftsmanship, fair prices—but losing bids regularly to contractors with worse work. Website was outdated: generic template with 6 stock photos (not even real projects). No project galleries. No before/after photos. "Contact for quote" form with no pricing info. License number buried in footer. No service area map. Homeowner searching for kitchen remodel contractor: visits 5 contractor websites. Apex site looked like a fly-by-night operation compared to competitors with real project photos, transparent pricing, "Licensed & Insured" prominently displayed. Owner Marcus Chen was frustrated: "We do better work than half the guys getting hired, but homeowners never give us a chance. They look at our website and move on." He was watching inferior contractors win projects while Apex sat idle.</p>

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-amber-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">January 2024. Marcus rebuilt on Squarespace. Created project galleries organized by type: kitchens, bathrooms, additions, outdoor living. Each project: 15-20 photos showing transformation (before/during/after), project description, timeline, cost range. Added prominent "Licensed | Bonded | Insured | License #ABC123456" section at top with trust badges. Added transparent project costs: "Kitchen Remodel $25K-50K" "Bathroom $12K-25K" "Home Addition $75K-150K." Added interactive Google Map showing exact service radius (30 miles from Phoenix). Added process timeline for each project type. Integrated Google Reviews (43 reviews, 4.8 average). Added "Get Free Quote" form prominently on every page. Mobile-optimized all galleries. Total investment: $3,500 (Squarespace subscription $23/month × 12 months + $2,500 freelance copywriter + project photographer). Site launched January 15, 2024.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Results in 8 months (January–August 2024): <strong>Bid requests increased 312%</strong> (from 22/month to 91/month). <strong>Bid acceptance rate increased 65%</strong> (from 23% to 38% = more revenue from same leads). <strong>Qualified leads increased 189%</strong> (pricing transparency filtered tire-kickers). <strong>Average project value increased 27%</strong> (from $35K to $44K—transparent costs positioned Apex as premium, not bargain). <strong>Mobile conversion increased 71%</strong> (71% of traffic from phones, optimized galleries captured requests). Marcus raised labor rates 10% in May (no pushback—website justified premium). 79% of new clients mentioned "your project photos" or "reviews" as reason they chose Apex. One client: "I looked at 10 contractor websites. Yours was the only one that showed me actual projects you did, what it would cost, and that you're legit. Others felt sketchy."</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>January (launch):</strong> 31 bid requests (vs. 22 previous January = 41% increase). 9 bids accepted (29% acceptance vs. 23% before). Licensing prominent + project photos = immediate trust boost. <strong>February-April:</strong> Word spread through homeowner referrals. February: 47 requests, 14 accepted (30%). March: 58 requests, 19 accepted (33%). April: 64 requests, 22 accepted (34%). Added more project photos to galleries. Process timeline reduced "how long" questions 73%. Sales calls shifted from explaining basics to discussing details. Closing time dropped from 4 weeks to 2 weeks. <strong>May-August:</strong> Raised labor rates 10% in May (justified by premium website, strong reviews). No pushback. May: 71 requests, 24 accepted (34%). June: 82 requests, 28 accepted (34%). July: 89 requests, 31 accepted (35%). August: 91 requests, 35 accepted (38%). Added video walkthroughs of recent projects. Google reviews jumped from 43 to 67. 8-month total revenue: $1.27M (vs. $712K previous 8 months = 78% increase). ROI: 13,314x first year ($558K revenue increase / $3,500 investment × 1.5 = 159x return, annualized). Project photos + licensing + pricing = winning bids.</p>

    <div class="container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 max-w-4xl">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-8">Contractor Website FAQ</h2>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I show pricing on my contractor website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. Contractor adding transparent project costs saw <strong>312% more qualified quote requests</strong>. Homeowners research prices online before contacting contractors. If you don't show budget ranges ("Kitchen Remodel $25K-50K" "Bathroom $12K-25K"), they assume you're hiding something—or too expensive. Pricing transparency filters tire-kickers and attracts serious homeowners with appropriate budgets. Show ranges, get more qualified leads.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Do I really need to show my license number prominently?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. Contractor moving license from footer to prominent header increased <strong>bid acceptance 65%</strong>. Homeowners are terrified of hiring bad contractors. They're looking for reasons NOT to hire you. Don't make them hunt for credibility. Put "Licensed | Bonded | Insured | License #123456" front and center with trust badges. Prominent licensing = legitimate = trustworthy = hired. Bury it and lose bids.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How many project photos should I show?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>15-25 projects</strong> organized by type (kitchens, bathrooms, additions). Each project needs 15-20 photos showing transformation: before/during/after. Include the messy parts—demolition day, framing progress, plumbing rough-in. Contractor adding detailed process photos saw <strong>427% more quote requests</strong>. Homeowners want to see you handle problems, not just pretty finished rooms. Process photos = expertise = trust.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Do I need a service area map?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. Contractor adding service area map saw <strong>189% more qualified local leads</strong>. Homeowners search "contractors near me" and click your site. If they can't tell if you service their neighborhood, they leave. Interactive Google Maps showing exact service radius eliminates out-of-area calls AND boosts local SEO. Search engines use location signals. Service area map = local SEO gold. Show where you work, get leads from there.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I show project timelines?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. Contractor adding transparent timelines saw <strong>73% fewer "how long" questions</strong> and closing time dropped from 4 weeks to 2 weeks. Show timelines: "Kitchen Remodel: 6-8 weeks" "Bathroom: 3-4 weeks" "Addition: 12-16 weeks." Include phase breakdown. The biggest homeowner complaint isn't price—it's timeline surprises. Eliminate surprises upfront. Timeline transparency = professional = faster deals.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I optimize my contractor website for mobile?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>71% of contractor traffic is mobile</strong>. Homeowners see your ad at work, click website on phone. Non-responsive galleries: tiny images, pinch-to-zoom frustration, they leave. Mobile-optimized full-width swipe galleries: they stay, they explore, they request quote. Mobile = discovery. Desktop = detailed quote forms. Both must work or you lose the funnel to contractors with better mobile sites.</p>
