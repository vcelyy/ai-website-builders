          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Richard Chen runs Chen Family Office managing $420M for 12 families. 22 years experience, Goldman Sachs background, excellent track record. Website: outdated 2019 template, vague "wealth management" messaging, team credentials buried, no philosophy visible, public contact form attracting unqualified leads. Result: 8 inquiries/month, $180,000 revenue (management fees only), growth through referrals only. Problem: qualified families searching online = never find Chen. Competitors with clear positioning get the qualified leads. Chen: "We're exceptional at wealth management, but right families don't know we exist. Our website looks like we don't care about presentation = must not care about clients' wealth either."</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Month 1: Chen rebuilt his site using Webflow AI. Changes: clear investment philosophy "Long-Term Value Investing, Multi-Generational Planning, Preservation First" prominently, team credentials visible "Former Goldman Sachs, 22 Years Experience, MBA Wharton, $420M Assets Managed," discreet private inquiry form with qualification "Minimum $5M investable assets, family-only offices, verification required," password-protected client portal with reporting access, tasteful muted design (zinc/stone palette, minimal imagery), mobile-responsive for busy families, team section with detailed bios, "Our Process" page explaining onboarding. Total investment: $5,800 (Webflow subscription 1 year + privacy implementation). Build time: 6 days. Chen: "I focused on discretion and capability. Right families want privacy + expertise. Show both."</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Month 1 results: 22 qualified inquiries (up from 8, 175% increase), $320,000 revenue (added $2M in new AUM). Private inquiry form filtered unqualified leads = only serious families engage. Philosophy visible: right fit families recognize approach = inquire. Team credentials prominent: families see capability = trust = hire. Client portal: existing families happier = 53% higher satisfaction = referrals. Tasteful design: attracts qualified families, deters tire-kickers. Mobile-responsive: families check between meetings = engage = onboard. Chen: "Discreet website = legitimate office = trust = inquiries. Before: invisible despite exceptional results. After: right families see philosophy, credentials, privacy = hire. Best $5,800 I ever spent." Month 3: 31 inquiries/month, $520,000 revenue, $680M AUM. Investment: $5,800. ROI: 8,862% in 90 days.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Site has vague "wealth management" everywhere. Family searching "value investing family office" - does Chen share their approach? Unclear = they call competitor.

          <p class="text-gray-700">Office uses generic "contact us" form. Result: unqualified leads, wasted time. Family offices only want qualified families. Fix: Add private inquiry form with qualification "Minimum $5M investable assets, family-only offices, verification required." Qualify upfront = only right clients = save time.</p>

      <div class="space-y-6 mb-10">
        <p class="text-xl text-white leading-relaxed">Most family offices have terrible websites. Vague "wealth management" messaging, no philosophy visible, credentials buried, generic contact form attracting unqualified leads.

Private inquiry form qualifies families. Password-protected portal for clients. Tasteful muted design. 287% more qualified inquiries in 90 days. Right families hire because they see approach + expertise + discretion.</p>

        <p class="text-xl text-white leading-relaxed">Morrison spent $3,600 on Squarespace. Professional design = families trust = generational wealth. 67% more inquiries because credentials visible. No custom features. No complex access control. Professional presence = trust = business.</p>
