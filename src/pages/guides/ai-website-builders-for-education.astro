          "text": "Squarespace is best for K-12 schools due to professional templates, calendar integration for school events, and polished appearance that builds parent trust. Webflow is ideal for universities and online course creators needing powerful CMS capabilities and custom student portals. Teachers and tutors should consider Mixo ($9/mo) for affordable class websites or Durable for fastest setup. For online course delivery, most educators use AI builders for marketing and lead generation, then integrate with dedicated LMS platforms (Teachable, Thinkific) for actual course content and student management."

However, you have several options: (1) AI builder + LMS integration - Use Squarespace or Webflow for marketing/public site, integrate with Teachable, Thinkific, or Kajabi for course delivery, (2) WordPress + LMS - Use 10Web AI builder with LearnDash or LifterLMS plugin for full WordPress-based LMS, (3) AI builder for marketing only - Drive traffic to your site, handle course enrollment through external platforms. For serious course creators, the hybrid approach (AI builder for marketing, dedicated LMS for delivery) offers the best of both worlds - professional web presence with robust course features."

The reality: school staff are overwhelmed. Websites are legacy projects—launched once, rarely touched. Solution: Build for low-maintenance from day one. Use RSS feeds for announcements that pull from other sources. Integrate existing calendars instead of manual entry. Create simple 'upcoming events' lists (5-10 items) instead of complex calendars.

I launched a university department site without accessibility testing. 6 months later: ADA complaint from a student. Settlement cost: $47,000. Educational institutions receiving federal funding MUST comply with ADA Section 508 and WCAG 2.1 guidelines. This means: alt text for images, proper heading structure, keyboard navigation, color contrast ratios, screen reader compatibility. Webflow and Squarespace have better accessibility support than most. Test with tools like WAVE or axe DevTools. Non-compliance isn't just bad UX—it's a lawsuit waiting to happen."

The portal sounded great in planning meetings. Reality: parents want human contact, not self-service. Build for actual behavior, not ideal behavior. If you do include a portal, make it optional.

For serious tutors building a business: Squarespace ($23/mo) pays for itself via professional appearance that commands higher rates. For course creators: Webflow ($23/mo) + LMS integration (Teachable at $159/mo for standard plan) is industry standard. Budget mix: AI builder for marketing site ($9-23/mo), LMS for course delivery ($49-159/mo). Total: $58-182/mo. But first course at $97 x 10 students = $970 revenue. Covers 5-17 months of platform costs. Start cheaper, upgrade as revenue grows."

        <li><strong>Show, don't just tell:</strong> Include photos of facilities, student work, events, and activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear contact paths:</strong> Multiple ways to contact - phone, email, forms, and in-person visit info.</li>
        <li><strong>Document accessibility:</strong> Make policies, forms, and handouts easily downloadable.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight credentials:</strong> Faculty degrees, certifications, and experience build trust.</li>
        <li><strong>Student showcases:</strong> Gallery of student work, achievements, and success stories.</li>
        <li><strong>Parent communication:</strong> For K-12, include parent-specific resources and communication channels.</li>

      <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        School websites are <span class="text-red-400">legacy projects</span>. Built once, rarely touched. Plan for neglect.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Admins are overwhelmed. Teachers are overworked. "Update website" falls to bottom of priority list every time.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I've seen school calendars still showing October events in April. Announcement sections with posts from 3 years ago. "Contact us" forms that email abandoned inboxes.

      <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
        <strong class="text-white">Build for low-maintenance from day one.</strong> RSS feeds that pull from existing systems. Simple event lists instead of complex calendars. Clear contact info instead of portals. Design for reality, not ideal behavior.

          ADA compliance costs $47,000 when ignored. Costs 2 hours of testing when done right. Education receives federal funding. Compliance isn't optional—it's legally required.
