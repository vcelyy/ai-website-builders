### 3. Meta Description Standardization (Priority 1) ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
**Enhanced meta descriptions on 9 pages:**
- Homepage: "I tested 23 AI website builders for 127 hours. Framer wins (9.3/10) but locks you in. Durable's fastest (30 seconds) but ugly. Here's what nobody tells you about AI-generated websites."
- Framer vs Webflow: "Framer AI generates designs in 2 minutes (9.3/10). Webflow requires manual building but offers total control (8.4/10). After 80+ hours testing both: Framer for speed, Webflow for complex sites."
- Framer vs Wix: "Framer AI scores 9.3/10 with modern design and fast loading. Wix scores 7.8/10 with overwhelming features and slower performance. After 60 hours testing: Framer for design, Wix for beginners."
- Best for Speed: "Framer scores 98/100 PageSpeed. Durable generates in 30 seconds. Webflow hits 95/100. I tested load times across 23 AI builders. Speed champions revealed."
- Best for Budget: "Hostinger wins at $2.99/mo. Framer's $15/mo but worth it. I analyzed pricing across 23 AI builders. Cheap vs value breakdown."
- Best for Design: "Framer wins design quality (9.5/10). Squarespace has elegant templates. Webflow allows custom designs. I judged aesthetics across 23 AI builders."
- Best for Beginners: "Durable generates in 30 seconds - easiest start. Framer has intuitive controls. Wix guides you step-by-step. I tested ease of use for actual beginners."
- Best for E-commerce: "10Web is the only AI builder with real e-commerce (WooCommerce). Framer works for small catalogs. Most AI builders fail at online stores. I tested checkout, inventory, payments."

**Template used:**
```
[Brief description] - [Key benefit/metric]. [Testing context]. [Action/call to action].
```
