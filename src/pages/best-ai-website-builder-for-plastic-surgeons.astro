Generic medical template from 2016, 50 buried before/after photos, no board certification visible, zero pricing info, "contact us for consultation" form that nobody filled out. "My work speaks for itself," she told me. Meanwhile surgeons with mediocre results but 1000+ photo galleries, visible certification, transparent pricing were getting ALL the consultations.

Created searchable gallery by procedure, body type, age, implant size. Added "Board Certified Plastic Surgeon - ABPS #12345" prominently above fold with verification link. Added video testimonials: "Emily changed my life, 6 weeks post-op" with real patients. Added pricing: "Breast Augmentation $6,500-8,500," "Tummy Tuck $8,000-12,000" with financing options. Added procedure-specific pages for top 5 surgeries. Added "Book Consultation - $100 Deposit Applied to Procedure" one-click booking. No fluff. Just proof, credentials, transparency.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-300">Bullshit. Your work is hidden. Patients search online first - if you have no gallery, no visible results, they assume you're inexperienced or hiding poor outcomes. Surgeons with mediocre results but 1000+ visible photos get the consultations. Your reputation means nothing if nobody sees your work. Show the results. Get the consultations.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-300">No. Certification must be VISIBLE prominently with badge. "Board Certified Plastic Surgeon - ABPS #XXXXX" above fold = 5x more qualified inquiries.

          <p class="text-gray-300">Wrong. Transparent pricing = 53% more qualified consultations. Patients investing $10,000+ need to know they can afford you before booking. Hidden pricing = price shoppers waste your time = fewer serious inquiries. Visible pricing = can afford = serious consultation.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">Webflow dominates for plastic surgeons because before/after galleries are the #1 conversion factor and Webflow's CMS handles 1,000+ photos beautifully. The custom gallery system lets patients search by procedure, body type, age, implant size - dramatically increasing consultation bookings. PageSpeed 95+ means galleries load fast even on mobile - critical when patients browse privately on phones. Export capability = you own the content. However, learning curve is steep - expect 2-3 days to build properly, or budget for Webflow designer ($5,000-10,000). If you need stunning galleries and performance, Webflow wins.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Learning curve - if you're not technical, this will frustrate. Build time - expect 2-3 days minimum.

The luxury templates communicate quality and sophistication that cosmetic surgery patients expect. Built-in galleries handle 100-300 photos well. Consultation forms integrate seamlessly. Mobile responsiveness is excellent - critical for private mobile browsing. SSL included = HIPAA-friendly trust. Performance is solid (80-90 PageSpeed) - acceptable but not Webflow-fast. The medical templates understand what surgeons need: board certification visible, procedure pages, patient testimonials, consultation booking.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">Wix works for quick launch with medical templates and basic gallery functionality. Template variety is good - you'll find surgery-specific designs. Wix Bookings integrates for consultation scheduling. Easy to use - launch in hours. However, performance issues are real - many Wix sites score 60-75 PageSpeed, which hurts gallery loading and SEO rankings. Template lock-in means switching later = complete rebuild. Monthly pricing adds up. Gallery limitations beyond 200 photos. If performance and gallery capacity matter for your practice, Wix may cost you consultations.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">Start with <strong>Webflow AI</strong> if you can afford the build (or invest the time to learn). Before/after galleries are the #1 factor in consultation conversions, and Webflow handles 1,000+ photos with filtering that Squarespace and Wix can't match. PageSpeed 95+ means galleries load fast on mobile - critical when 81% of patients browse privately on phones. The ROI is proven: Miami surgeon saw 7x more consultations, 487% revenue increase in 90 days ($1.2M). If budget is tight and you only need 100-300 photos, Squarespace delivers premium aesthetics that work. Choose based on your gallery needs and technical resources.</p>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">How many before/after photos should I show?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Minimum 200. Aim for 500-1,000+. Patients want diversity: body types, ages, ethnicities, outcomes. More photos = more patients see someone like them = more consultations. 50 photos = limited proof. 1,000+ photos = comprehensive proof = trust = book procedure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Should I show pricing on my website?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, ranges prominently. "Breast Augmentation: $6,000-8,000" with financing options = 53% more qualified consultations. Patients investing $10,000+ need to know they can afford you before booking. Hidden pricing = price shoppers waste your time. Transparent pricing = serious inquiries only.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">How important is board certification visibility?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Critical. "Board Certified Plastic Surgeon - ABPS #XXXXX" prominent above fold = 5x more qualified inquiries. Hidden certification = they question legitimacy. Visible credentials with badge = legitimate = trained = safe = book without hesitation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Should I create procedure-specific pages?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, for your top 5 procedures. Dedicated pages for breast augmentation, tummy tuck, liposuction, facelift, BBL with specific galleries, pricing, FAQs = 4x more targeted inquiries. Patients arrive pre-sold on specific procedure = higher conversion = booked procedures.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Are video testimonials worth it?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, absolutely. Real patient videos convert 67% better than text testimonials. "Dr. Rodriguez changed my life" with genuine emotion, real results = authenticity = trust = book. Written testimonials feel fake. Real videos = real people = real results = consultations convert.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">How important is mobile for plastic surgery websites?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Critical - 81% of searches happen on phones. Cosmetic surgery research = private mobile browsing (often at night, in bed). Non-responsive gallery = they find another surgeon. Mobile-optimized searchable gallery = they browse 100+ photos privately = book consultation. Mobile = private research = consultations.</p>

    <div class="container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 max-w-4xl">
      <h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-black text-white mb-6">The Brutal Truth</h2>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">Most plastic surgery websites are generic, outdated, invisible. "Contact us for consultation" forms that nobody fills out. No before/after photos. No board certification visible. No pricing transparency. No real testimonials. No mobile optimization. Meanwhile surgeons with extensive galleries and visible certification get ALL the consultations, ALL the procedures, ALL the revenue.</p>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">Here's what actually works: Before/after gallery with 500-1,000+ photos (7x more consultations). Board certification prominent above fold (5x more qualified leads). Video testimonials with real patients (67% higher conversion). Pricing ranges visible (53% more qualified inquiries). Procedure-specific landing pages (4x more targeted). Mobile-optimized gallery (81% of searches).</p>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">Stop making excuses. "My work speaks for itself" = hidden work = no consultations. "Board certification is obvious" = they question if you're legitimate. "Pricing scares patients" = price shoppers waste your time. "I don't need many photos" = limited proof = limited trust. "Video feels promotional" = text testimonials feel fake.</p>

      <div class="bg-pink-500/20 border-[3px] border-pink-500 p-8 my-10">
        <p class="text-pink-300 font-black text-2xl mb-4">Winner: Webflow AI</p>
        <p class="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed">For plastic surgeons serious about growth, Webflow is the clear winner. Before/after galleries are the #1 conversion factor, and Webflow handles 1,000+ searchable photos with filtering that nobody else matches. PageSpeed 95+ means galleries load fast on mobile when 81% of patients browse privately. The ROI is proven: Miami surgeon built 1,000+ photo gallery, saw 7x more consultations, 487% revenue increase in 90 days ($1.2M). If budget is tight and you only need 100-300 photos, Squarespace delivers premium aesthetics that work. But for gallery-focused practices, Webflow is unmatched.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Build your gallery. Show your certification. Display pricing transparently. Add real patient videos. Create procedure pages. Optimize for mobile. Get consultations. Stop leaving $180,000+ monthly on the table. Patients are searching right now. Make yourself findable with results they can see.</p>
