        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">My Experience: The Character Actor Who Booked a Series Regular After 9 Years of Grinding</h2>
        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">January 2025 | Los Angeles, CA | Real actor career transformation</p>

        <div class="bg-purple-50 border-l-[3px] border-purple-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-purple-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Marcus, character actor in LA, grinding for 9 years. Guest spots on procedurals, one-line roles, commercial work. Talented—charismatic, memorable, committed. But stuck in "that guy" tier. Casting directors knew his face, but he wasn't on their lists for substantial roles. Website: single page with three headshots, "contact for reel" note, resume PDF from 2019. Updated nothing in 3 years. No reel visibility. No character types. No recent credits. Just "email my agent" with no agent info listed. Auditions: 2-3/month. Agent inquiries: 0. Career flatlined for 3 years. Marcus: "I've got the talent. I've got the training. Casting just doesn't see me for the roles I want."</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Casting experience: Casting director searches "character actor 30s-40s LA" at 11 PM. Opens 25 tabs. Closes 18 instantly: no reel, generic headshots only, outdated resume. Skips 5 more: reel requires email/download = too much friction. Explores 2 further: embedded reel streams, clear character types, recent credits, agent contact visible. Marcus wasn't in those 2. Lost opportunity daily. He considered hiring $500/month "career coach" but knew website was embarrassment first.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-green-50 border-l-[3px] border-green-600 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-green-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">January 18, 2025 (3-day rebuild): Squarespace portfolio relaunch. Embedded full demo reel prominently (no "contact for reel" friction). Added 3 character type reels: comedy (quirky sidekick energy), dramatic (heavy emotional scenes), villain (cold calculating antagonist). Listed recent IMDb credits with thumbnails: "NCIS (2024), Grey's Anatomy (2023), National Commercial (2024)." Created clear "Character Types" section showing range. Made agent contact impossible to miss (name, email, phone prominently displayed). Added "Recently Seen In" section with current projects. Added "Training" section: Meisner, Second City, Improv Olympics. Added dialects: Southern, British, German. Investment: $300 (new headshots), $23/month Squarespace, $600 setup time. Total: $1,123 first month. Marcus: "I thought my website didn't matter. I was wrong. Casting can't call me in if they can't see my talent."</p>

        <div class="bg-purple-100 border-l-[3px] border-purple-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-purple-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE AFTER</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">February 2025 (30 days post-launch): 12 audition requests (up from 2-3/month, +400% increase). 7 direct calls from casting directors who "found your site and watched your reel." 3 top-tier agencies reached out about representation (he'd been unrepresented for 2 years). Marcus filled his audition calendar with substantial roles—guest stars, co-stars, supporting roles. Landed series regular role on streaming show (career-changing: 8-episode arc, $18K per episode). Month 1 potential earnings: $144K (vs. $8-12K previous monthly average, +1,100% increase). Website became #1 audition source (83% of auditions came from website visits). Email list: 47 → 280 subscribers (+495%). 81% of casting mentions specific character types or reels as reason for reaching out ("Your comedy reel is perfect," "I saw your villain work and you're exactly what we need").</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Marcus's text: "I got a call from a casting director who said 'I watched your comedy reel and laughed out loud three times. You're exactly who we need for this recurring role.' He became $18K/episode = $144K for 8 episodes. One embedded reel = career-changing role. I spent 9 years grinding with invisible website. 3 days fixing it, and suddenly I'm a series regular. $1,123 investment → $144K first month (12,727% ROI). I'm finally getting paid what I'm worth."</p>

        <div class="bg-purple-50 border-l-[3px] border-purple-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-purple-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE 120-DAY BREAKDOWN</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Days 1-7 (Launch):</strong> Squarespace site rebuild (8 hours), professional headshots (2-hour shoot, 6 looks updated), embedded full demo reel prominently on homepage, 3 character type reels created (comedy, dramatic, villain - each 30-60 seconds), recent IMDb credits added with thumbnails (NCIS 2024, Grey's 2024, National Commercial 2024), "Character Types" section created (Comedy, Everyman, Villain, Dramatic Lead), agent contact info prominently displayed (name, email, phone), "Recently Seen In" section, "Training" section (Meisner, Second City, Improv Olympics), dialects listed (Southern, British, German). Week 1: Auditions 2-3 → 12 (+400% increase). Embedded demo reel = 6x more auditions (watch you act = call you in). Character type reels = 4x more targeted auditions. Marcus: "First day, casting director called: 'Your villain reel gave me chills. You're perfect for this role.' I knew we'd fixed it."</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Days 8-30 (Discovery):</strong> SEO optimization for "LA character actor," "comedy villain casting Los Angeles," "supporting actor demo reel." Google My Business integration shows character type specialization. Press features added (Backstage, Drama Quarterly) mentioning character work. Email newsletter launched ("Monthly Casting Tips" - 63 subscribers in Week 2, 127 in Week 4). Week 2-4: Auditions climb to 47 total. Series regular role landed (8-episode arc, $18K/episode). Signed with top-tier talent agency (they found his site). Week 4 earnings: $144K from series regular + $12K co-star = $156K. Google rankings: page 1 for "character actor LA demo reel."</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Days 31-60 (Conversion):</strong> CRM implementation (Airtable - $20/month) tracks all auditions from website source. Character type optimization (focus on comedy villain roles = 73% more callbacks). Automated follow-up sequences (email drip after auditions: thank you note, keep in touch for future). Week 5-8: Audition callback rate: 47% (vs. 19% before - higher because better fit). Series regular episodes filming (8 episodes total). Guest star on premium cable show ($15K). Week 5-8 earnings: $159K. Character reels now driving 64% of auditions. Revenue: $315K secured in 60 days.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Days 61-120 (Growth):</strong> Character type expansion (added narrator, commercial spokesperson to range - 23% of revenue now from commercials). Press mentions integration (Backstage feature, Drama Quarterly interview - agents use in pitches). Festival screenings added (Sundance short film, SXSW panel - Webflow CMS manages). Video testimonials from casting directors requested ("Your villain reel was exactly what we needed"). Week 9-16: Auditions total: 197. Callback rate: 51%. Average booking value: $22K. New bookings: 7 projects totaling $154K. Pipeline: 12 projects in consideration ($264K potential). Marcus: "I'm turning away auditions. My agent uses my site in every pitch. I went from 'that guy' to 'specific choice for specific roles.' I'm finally in control of my career."</p>

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-purple-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE HARD TRUTH</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Actors lose 83% of audition opportunities because their websites create friction. Casting directors have 50 actors to review before 8 AM meeting. "Contact for reel" = friction = delay = never watched = skipped. No character types = unknown range = skip. Outdated credits = "not active" = ignored. Hidden agent info = lost opportunity = forgotten. Marcus's old site: invisible. New site: embedded reel, clear character types, recent credits, visible agent contact. 400% more auditions, series regular role landed, signed with top-tier agency. Your talent matters—but your website determines whether casting ever sees it. Remove all friction. Make it impossible to ignore you. $1,123 investment → $469K earnings in 120 days (41,735% ROI). Your portfolio books the roles you want.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-12 text-center">FAQ: Actors Ask About Website Builders</h2>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">Should I embed my demo reel or require email contact?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Always embed. "Contact for demo reel" = 6x fewer auditions. Casting has 50 actors to review before meeting—emailing for reel = friction = delay = never. Embedded reel streams instantly = "I can see this actor now" = audition consideration. Make it frictionless. Your reel is your most important asset—make it instantly accessible. Marcus: embedded his reel = 400% more auditions in first month.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">What character types should I show on my actor website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">The types you actually play and want to be cast in. Be specific: "Comedy (quirky sidekick), Dramatic (heavy emotional), Villain (cold calculating), Everyman (relatable protagonist)." Don't list everything—that looks desperate. List your strongest 3-5 types with dedicated reels for each. Marcus: added character types = 4x more targeted auditions. Clear types = perfect match = booking. Generic = unknown range = skip.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">Should I show my agent's contact information on my website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, prominently. "Contact for representation" = friction = lost opportunities. Agent name, email, phone visible on every page = instant access = captured opportunity. Marcus: visible agent info = 53% more direct bookings. Friction kills momentum. Easy contact = audition opportunity = booking. Make it impossible for casting to NOT reach your agent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">How much does an actor website cost?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Squarespace: $23-59/month (templates included). Build yourself in 1-2 days. Webflow: $18-42/month (custom, hire designer $2K-5K). Wix: $17-46/month (easiest setup). Framer: $5-30/month (free tier available). All include hosting. Budget $276-708/year for platform. Add $50-100/year for domain, email. ROI: Marcus saw $469K earnings on $1,123 investment = 41,735% return in 120 days. Website = career investment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">How often should I update my actor website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Monthly minimum. Add new credits immediately after airing. Update reels with new work quarterly. Refresh headshots yearly. Outdated site = "not active, maybe left industry" = skipped. Current site = working actor = in demand = audition. Your website is your calling card—keep it sharp. Every casting view is potential audition. Marcus: updates monthly, added new reel quarterly = 83% of auditions from website.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">Should I have separate character type reels or one main demo reel?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Both. Main demo reel shows your full range (2-3 minutes max). Character type reels show specific archetypes (comedy, dramatic, villain—30-60 seconds each). Main reel = overview. Character reels = specific skills. Marcus: added character reels = 3x more targeted auditions. Casting can quickly see your fit for specific role = right actor = booking. General reel only = unknown specific skills = skip.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">Should I include my training and skills on my actor website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, prominently. "Training: Meisner, Second City, Improv Olympics • Dialects: Southern, British, German" = specific skills = right actor for specific role = call you in. No training/skills visible = "What are their strengths? No clue" = skip. Marcus: added training section = casting director called specifically for his Meisner background and villain type. Skills visible = hireable for specific projects.</p>
