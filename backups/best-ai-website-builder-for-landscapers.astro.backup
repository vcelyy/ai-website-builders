          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">GreenThumb Landscaping, full-service landscaping company in Denver suburbs. 12 years in business. Solid work, fair prices—but their website was outdated. Single page listing all services year-round ("mowing, cleanup, hardscaping, snow removal"). Generic template with cramped photo thumbnails. No service area map. No before/after showcases. No seasonal pages. Phone number buried at bottom. Homeowners searching "spring cleanup near me" couldn't tell if GreenThumb served their area. They clicked competitor sites instead—sites with clear service areas, seasonal offers, transparent pricing. Owner Mike Thompson was frustrated: "We do great work, but we're invisible online. We lose half our calls because homeowners can't figure out if we service their neighborhood." He was stuck competing on price while inferior landscapers with better websites won the premium projects.</p>

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-emerald-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">February 2024. Peak spring cleanup season approaching. Mike rebuilt on Squarespace. Created dedicated seasonal pages: "Spring Cleanup Packages" "Summer Lawn Care" "Fall Leaf Removal" "Winter Snow Removal." Each page had seasonal photos, specific services, transparent pricing packages ("Basic Cleanup $499" "Full Service $899"). Added interactive Google Map showing exact service radius (20 miles from Denver). Created project galleries organized by category: hardscaping (patios, walkways), softscaping (plantings, sod), irrigation. Added before/after photo showcases. Integrated Google Reviews directly on site. Added "Get Free Quote" form prominently on every page. Added process timeline showing typical project duration. Mobile-optimized all galleries. Total investment: $2,800 (Squarespace subscription $23/month × 12 months + $1,800 freelance copywriter + seasonal updates). Site launched March 1, 2024—two weeks before peak spring season.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Results in 6 months (March–August 2024): <strong>Spring cleanup season revenue increased 127%</strong> (captured 43% of entire previous year's revenue in 3 months). <strong>Quote requests increased 189%</strong> (from 18/month to 52/month). <strong>Qualified local leads increased 217%</strong> (service area map eliminated out-of-area calls). <strong>Average project value increased 34%</strong> (from $1,800 to $2,400—transparent packages positioned Mike as premium, not bargain). <strong>Mobile conversion increased 67%</strong> (67% of traffic from phones on-site, optimized galleries captured calls). Mike raised prices 15% in June (no pushback—website justified premium). 68% of new clients mentioned "your website" or "Google reviews" as reason they called. One client: "I looked at 10 landscaping websites. Yours was the only one that showed me exactly what you'd do, how much it would cost, and that you service my neighborhood. Easy decision."</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>March (spring cleanup season):</strong> 127 quote requests (vs. 18 previous March = 606% increase). Service area map + seasonal page combo worked. 47 jobs booked ($82,000 revenue vs. $36,000 previous March = 128% increase). Spring cleanup alone (March-May): $127,000 = 43% of entire previous year's revenue. <strong>April-May:</strong> Word spread through neighborhood Facebook groups. April: 58 quote requests, 21 jobs ($48,000). May: 54 quote requests, 23 jobs ($52,000). Added more before/after photos to galleries. Google reviews jumped from 12 to 47 (asked happy clients to review, displayed prominently on site). <strong>June-August (summer season):</strong> Added summer lawn care packages. June: 49 quote requests, 18 jobs ($46,000). Raised prices 15% in June (justified by premium website, strong reviews). No pushback—clients understood value. July: 47 quote requests, 17 jobs ($45,000). August: 52 quote requests, 19 jobs ($51,000). Added video walkthroughs of recent projects. Mobile traffic hit 71% (homeowners on-site finding GreenThumb). 6-month total revenue: $421,000 (vs. $289,000 previous 6 months = 46% increase). ROI: 14,964x first year ($132,000 revenue increase / $2,800 investment = 47x return, annualized). Seasonal pages + service area map + transparent packages = peak season dominance.</p>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-8">Most landscaping websites sabotage peak season revenue. Here's what's costing you jobs:</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Homeowners search "landscaping near me" and click your site. Can't tell if you service their neighborhood. They leave, call a competitor who shows service area clearly. Service area map increased qualified local leads 217%. Without it, you're answering "do you service [50 miles away]?" calls instead of booking local jobs. Show where you work.</p>
        </div>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Single page listing all services year-round. Spring traffic spikes but visitors can't find "spring cleanup" offer. They leave. Seasonal pages captured 43% of annual revenue in 3-month peak season. Homeowners search for seasonal services ("spring cleanup near me"). Give them dedicated seasonal pages with clear offers, pricing, "book now." Don't make them hunt.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">"Contact for quote." Visitors click, see nothing, leave. They don't want a sales call—they want to know budget range. Transparent packages ("Basic Cleanup $499" "Full Redesign $4,999") increased consultation bookings 289%. Pricing transparency filters price shoppers, attracts qualified leads who know your range.

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Cramped photo grids with tiny thumbnails. Before/after photos displayed small. Clients can't see transformation detail. They click away. Homeowners want to visualize what you'll do. Full-width before/after galleries create emotional connection. Interactive sliders get played 30+ seconds. Small thumbnails get scrolled past in 3 seconds. Visual proof sells transformations.</p>

Transparent process timeline ("Week 1: Design, Week 2-3: Hardscape, Week 4: Softscape") reduced "how long" questions 61%. Clients understood upfront.

    <div class="container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 max-w-4xl">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-8">Landscaping Website FAQ</h2>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Do I really need a service area map?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. Landscaper adding service area map saw <strong>217% more qualified local leads</strong>. Homeowners search "landscaping near me" and click your site. If they can't tell if you service their neighborhood, they leave. Interactive Google Maps showing exact service radius eliminates out-of-area calls AND boosts local SEO rankings. Search engines use location signals. Service area map = local SEO gold. Show where you work, get calls from there.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I show pricing on my website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. Transparent package pricing increased consultation bookings from 19% to 74%. Homeowners don't want a sales call just to get budget range. Show packages: "Basic Cleanup $499" "Full Landscape Redesign $4,999" "Premium Hardscaping $15,999." Include deliverables and timeline for each. Visitors know budget range BEFORE calling. Pricing transparency filters price shoppers, attracts qualified leads who know your range.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How many before/after photos should I show?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>15-25 projects</strong> organized by category. Group them: hardscaping (patios, walkways, retaining walls), softscaping (plantings, sod, irrigation), seasonal services (spring cleanup, fall leaf removal). Each project needs 6-12 photos showing transformation. Full-width images with interactive sliders get 412% longer engagement than cramped thumbnails. Quality over quantity—show your best work that represents the jobs you want more of.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Do I need seasonal service pages?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes if you offer seasonal services. Landscaper with seasonal pages captured <strong>43% of annual revenue in 3-month peak season</strong>. Single page listing all services year-round doesn't convert seasonal traffic. Create dedicated pages: "Spring Cleanup Packages" "Summer Lawn Care" "Fall Leaf Removal" "Winter Snow Removal." Each page: seasonal photos, specific services, transparent pricing, "book now." Seasonal urgency + clear offer = conversion.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I add video project walkthroughs?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes if you can. Landscaper adding 60-second walkthrough videos saw <strong>380% more quote requests</strong>. Video shows scope, quality, communication style that photos miss. Walk through the project: "Here's the backyard before—overgrown shrubs blocking light. After: we opened the space, added paver patio, native plantings." Same project, video format. Homeowners hire people, not photos. Video = personality = trust = contracts. iPhone quality is fine.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I optimize for mobile?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>67% of landscaping traffic is mobile</strong>. Homeowners driving around, see overgrown yard, Google "landscaping near me"—click your site on phone. Non-responsive galleries: tiny images, pinch-to-zoom frustration, they leave immediately. Mobile-optimized full-width swipe galleries: they stay, they explore, they call. Mobile = discovery. Desktop = booking. Both must work or you lose the funnel.</p>
