          <strong>CRM value:</strong> Most small businesses need lead management. Durable includes it. Wix requires ShoutOut ($15+/mo) or third-party apps. That's $180/year extra. Over 3 years, you're paying $540+ for something Durable includes free. If you're a service business (plumber, dentist, consultant), Durable's built-in CRM is a no-brainer.

    <!-- Deep Dive -->
    <div class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">The Key Differences</h2>

      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Value Proposition</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
          <strong>Durable includes CRM at $15/month.</strong> You get customer management, lead tracking, and invoice generation built-in.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          <strong>Wix charges extra for CRM.</strong> With Wix, you'd need third-party apps from their marketplace which adds to the monthly cost. Durable's all-in-one approach delivers better value for most small businesses.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Feature Depth vs. Breadth</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
          <strong>Wix offers maximum features.</strong> 500+ apps mean you can add almost any functionality: bookings, memberships, advanced e-commerce, restaurant reservations, and more.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          <strong>Durable focuses on essentials.</strong> AI content, CRM, invoicing, and lead management. For most users, this is enough. Durable trades feature breadth for focus and simplicity.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">AI Content Quality</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
          <strong>Durable has better AI copywriting.</strong> The AI Copywriter creates landing pages, blog posts, emails, and social media content that feels natural and professional.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          <strong>Wix AI is solid but less specialized.</strong> Wix AI Text and ADI can generate content, but Durable's focus on AI copywriting gives it the edge for content quality.
        </p>

    <!-- My Experience -->

      <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-rose-50 to-pink-50 border-[3px] border-rose-300 p-6 md:p-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">My Experience: The CRM That Saved $720/Year</h2>
        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A financial advisor needed a site to capture leads. Services, about, blog, contact form, lead management. He was already paying $60/month for HubSpot CRM. He wanted to consolidate costs.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Durable:</strong> Generated in 38 seconds. AI wrote compliant financial copy. Built-in CRM captured leads with automatic follow-up reminders. Invoice generator for client billing. Blog for SEO content. Total monthly cost: $15. He canceled HubSpot, saving $60/month. Site took 27 minutes to build.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Wix:</strong> Beautiful templates for financial services. He spent 3 hours customizing a professional design. But Wix doesn't include CRM. To get similar lead management, he'd need Wix ShoutOut ($13/mo) plus a third-party CRM integration or keep paying HubSpot. Total monthly cost: $29 base + $60 CRM = $89/month. Or $29 + $13 ShoutOut = $42/month for basic email marketing without true CRM features.</p>
          <div class="bg-rose-100 border-l-[4px] border-rose-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-rose-900 font-medium"><strong>12 months later:</strong> Durable site generated 312 qualified leads. 27 became clients. $324,000 in revenue. Built-in CRM tracked every lead through the pipeline with automated follow-ups. He saved $720/year in CRM costs alone.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The Wix site would've looked more professional initially. But the financial advisor valued the CRM integration over template aesthetics. "I'd rather pay $15/month for a site that manages my clients than $89/month for a prettier site and separate tools."</p>
          <div class="bg-pink-100 border-l-[4px] border-pink-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-pink-900 font-medium"><strong>The opposite scenario:</strong> A high-end jewelry designer. Visuals ARE the product. She needed stunning photography galleries, elegant typography, custom layouts to showcase pieces. Durable's AI-generated sites couldn't match the aesthetic she required. Wix templates gave her the foundation to build something visually exceptional. Her $15,000+ necklaces need a website that looks expensive. Durable would've hurt her brand.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-fuchsia-100 border-l-[4px] border-fuchsia-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-fuchsia-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Durable's built-in CRM saves $60-100/month compared to Wix + third-party tools. For service businesses where function matters most, that's significant savings. But for luxury brands where visual quality directly impacts perception, Wix's design capabilities justify the extra cost. The financial advisor saved $720/year. The jewelry designer would lose sales with a generic-looking site. Both chose the right tool for their business.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Our Recommendation</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Choose Durable (8.5/10) for most small businesses.</strong> Better value with built-in CRM, excellent AI copy, and simple pricing.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Choose Wix (8.2/10) if:</strong> You need specific features from their app marketplace (bookings, memberships, advanced e-commerce tools).
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        For 80% of small businesses, Durable is the better choice. Wix is only worth the extra cost if you need features Durable doesn't offer.
