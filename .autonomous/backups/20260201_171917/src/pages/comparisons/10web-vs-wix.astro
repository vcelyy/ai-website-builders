          "text": "10Web (8.3/10) and Wix (8.2/10) are very close overall but serve different users. 10Web is better for WordPress users or those wanting WordPress power with AI generation - offering up to 10 free AI-generated sites, code export, and the massive WordPress plugin ecosystem. Wix is better for users who want extensive features without WordPress complexity, with a huge app marketplace and more flexible template-based building. 10Web offers better value (8.0/10 vs 7.5/10) with $10/month pricing and 10 free sites. Wix offers better ease of use (8.5/10 vs 7.0/10) with its drag-and-drop editor. Choose 10Web if you want WordPress with AI or code export capability. Choose Wix if you want maximum features without WordPress learning curve."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "10Web is more affordable than Wix with better free tier value. 10Web offers up to 10 free AI-generated sites and paid plans start at $10/month per site. Over 3 years, 10Web costs approximately $360 total for basic plans. Wix starts at $17/month for basic plans, $29/month for premium, up to $159/month for enterprise features. Over 3 years, Wix costs $612-5724 depending on plan level. 10Web's 10 free sites offer is exceptional value for users needing multiple sites. Wix has higher pricing but includes more built-in features without needing plugins. For single sites, both are similarly priced at the entry level. For multiple sites, 10Web is significantly better value. Both offer free tiers for testing."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "10Web offers code export since it's WordPress-based. You can export your entire site and host it anywhere WordPress runs. This gives you platform independence and the ability to continue development manually or migrate to different hosting. Wix does not offer code export - your website stays on Wix's servers permanently. You're locked into their platform. This is a major difference if you care about owning your code or having the flexibility to move platforms. With 10Web, you get WordPress portability and can self-host if desired. With Wix, you're dependent on their hosting indefinitely. If code export and platform independence matter, 10Web is the clear winner. If you don't care about code export and want an easier all-in-one solution, Wix works fine."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "You don't need deep WordPress knowledge to use 10Web's AI generation, but WordPress familiarity helps significantly. 10Web's AI can generate a complete WordPress site from a URL or prompt without any WordPress knowledge. However, once generated, you're working with WordPress - which means: understanding plugins and themes, navigating the WordPress dashboard, managing updates, troubleshooting conflicts. If you've never used WordPress, 10Web has a learning curve (7.0/10 ease). If you know WordPress, 10Web is a fast AI-powered shortcut. The brutal truth: if WordPress intimidates you, 10Web won't change that - it's still WordPress under the hood. Choose Wix if you want to avoid WordPress complexity entirely."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Wix has more built-in features while 10Web relies on the WordPress plugin ecosystem. Wix includes: extensive built-in tools, one-click integrations, unified interface, everything works together seamlessly. 10Web features come from: 60,000+ WordPress plugins, WooCommerce for e-commerce, theme ecosystem for design, third-party integrations. The difference is philosophy: Wix gives you everything out of the box but less flexibility. 10Web gives you unlimited options through plugins but requires assembly. For beginners wanting features that just work, Wix wins. For users willing to research and install plugins, 10Web offers more depth and customization potential. Also consider cost: Wix apps often have monthly fees. WordPress plugins are frequently free or one-time purchases."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "10Web offers dramatically better free tier value with up to 10 free AI-generated sites. 10Web's free tier includes: AI generation for up to 10 sites, hosting on 10Web subdomains, full WordPress functionality, access to free plugins and themes. Wix's free tier includes: one site with Wix ads, limited storage and bandwidth, restricted features, Wix subdomain only. 10Web's 10 free sites offer is exceptional for testing multiple ideas, managing microsites, or handling multiple projects. Wix's free tier is adequate for testing one site but requires upgrading quickly. If you need multiple sites or want to test extensively before committing, 10Web's free tier is unbeatable. For single site testing, both work but 10Web gives more room to explore."

Choose Wix if: you're a beginner wanting ease of use, you prefer an all-in-one solution without plugins, you want extensive built-in features, you don't want to manage WordPress updates, you value simplicity over maximum power, you're willing to pay for convenience. The decision framework: if WordPress doesn't scare you, 10Web offers more value and power. If you want features that just work without thinking, Wix justifies its premium with convenience."

        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A restaurant owner needed a new site. Old WordPress site was hacked and full of malware. He hated WordPress. "Too complicated, too many updates, always breaking." He wanted something easier.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Wix:</strong> I rebuilt his site in Wix. Drag-and-drop. Easy. Added reservations through OpenTable integration. Connected to his Yelp reviews. Built a menu page. Looked good. Total time: 6 hours. Monthly cost: $23 (plus $29/month for reservations app = $52 total).</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>10Web:</strong> Used AI to recreate his old site. Clean WordPress install. Added a restaurant theme. Used WP Restaurant Manager plugin (free). Connected OpenTable (free plugin). Added a review schema plugin (free). Monthly cost: $10 for 10Web hosting.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-indigo-900 font-medium"><strong>3 months later:</strong> He chose Wix. "I know it costs more. But I can make changes myself. If I need to add a special or update hours, I don't need to call anyone. With WordPress, I was always afraid I'd break something."</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Fair point. Wix's simplicity has real value for non-technical users.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>But then the opposite scenario:</strong> A marketing consultant needed a site with advanced features: lead capture forms, CRM integration, client portal, automated email sequences, appointment scheduling, membership area.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Wix:</strong> Built it. But each feature required a separate app. Forms app ($10/mo), CRM app ($15/mo), membership app ($25/mo), bookings app ($17/mo), Ascend by Wix for email marketing ($13/mo). Total: $23 base + $80 in apps = $103/month. And the apps didn't always talk to each other seamlessly.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>10Web:</strong> Built with free WordPress plugins. Contact Form 7 (free), FluentCRM ($49/yr = $4/mo), MemberPress ($179/yr = $15/mo), Amelia bookings ($59/yr = $5/mo), MailPoet for email (free). Total: $10 for 10Web + $24 in plugins = $34/month. And everything integrated natively through WordPress.</p>
          <div class="bg-blue-100 border-l-[4px] border-blue-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-blue-900 font-medium"><strong>The math:</strong> $103 vs $34 monthly. Over 2 years? $2,472 vs $816. That's a $1,656 difference. The consultant chose 10Web. "I'm technical enough to manage WordPress. I'll take the $1,600 savings."</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-sky-100 border-l-[4px] border-sky-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-sky-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Wix is easier for simple sites. 10Web pays off when you need multiple features. Every Wix app has a monthly fee. WordPress plugins are often one-time purchases or much cheaper. If you need 3+ apps, the math quickly favors 10Web. If you need 1-2 features and hate technology, pay the Wix premium.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Is 10Web or Wix better for website building?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">10Web (8.3/10) and Wix (8.2/10) are very close overall but serve different users. 10Web is better for WordPress users or those wanting WordPress power with AI generation - offering up to 10 free AI-generated sites, code export, and the massive WordPress plugin ecosystem. Wix is better for users who want extensive features without WordPress complexity, with a huge app marketplace and more flexible template-based building.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-l-4 border-slate-500 bg-slate-50 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What is the price difference between 10Web and Wix?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">10Web is more affordable than Wix with better free tier value. 10Web offers up to 10 free AI-generated sites and paid plans start at $10/month per site. Over 3 years, 10Web costs approximately $360 total for basic plans. Wix starts at $17/month for basic plans, $29/month for premium, up to $159/month for enterprise features. Over 3 years, Wix costs $612-5724 depending on plan level.</p>

        <div class="border-l-4 border-slate-500 bg-slate-50 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I export code from 10Web or Wix?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">10Web offers code export since it's WordPress-based. You can export your entire site and host it anywhere WordPress runs. This gives you platform independence and the ability to continue development manually or migrate to different hosting. Wix does not offer code export - your website stays on Wix's servers permanently. You're locked into their platform.</p>

        <div class="border-l-4 border-slate-500 bg-slate-50 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Do I need to know WordPress to use 10Web?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">You don't need deep WordPress knowledge to use 10Web's AI generation, but WordPress familiarity helps significantly. 10Web's AI can generate a complete WordPress site from a URL or prompt without any WordPress knowledge. However, once generated, you're working with WordPress - which means understanding plugins and themes, navigating the WordPress dashboard, managing updates, and troubleshooting conflicts.</p>

        <div class="border-l-4 border-slate-500 bg-slate-50 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Which has better features: 10Web or Wix?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Wix has more built-in features while 10Web relies on the WordPress plugin ecosystem. Wix includes extensive built-in tools, one-click integrations, unified interface, and everything works together seamlessly. 10Web features come from 60,000+ WordPress plugins, WooCommerce for e-commerce, theme ecosystem for design, and third-party integrations. Wix apps often have monthly fees while WordPress plugins are frequently free or one-time purchases.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How do the free tiers compare: 10Web vs Wix?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">10Web offers dramatically better free tier value with up to 10 free AI-generated sites. 10Web's free tier includes AI generation for up to 10 sites, hosting on 10Web subdomains, full WordPress functionality, and access to free plugins and themes. Wix's free tier includes one site with Wix ads, limited storage and bandwidth, restricted features, and Wix subdomain only.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">When should I choose 10Web over Wix or vice versa?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Choose 10Web if you're already comfortable with WordPress, you need code export or platform independence, you require multiple sites (up to 10 free), you want access to WooCommerce and WordPress plugins, you're a developer or technical user, or budget is a concern with multiple sites. Choose Wix if you're a beginner wanting ease of use, you prefer an all-in-one solution without plugins, you want extensive built-in features, you don't want to manage WordPress updates, or you value simplicity over maximum power.</p>
