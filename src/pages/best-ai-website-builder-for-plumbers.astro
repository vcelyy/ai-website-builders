        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">Mike Thompson ran Thompson Plumbing in Denver - 18 years, 3 trucks, solid emergency work. But website? Generic template from 2015, no 24/7 emergency visibility, phone number buried on contact page, vague "we handle all plumbing" services, no license info visible, no service area map. "We're busy enough through word-of-mouth," he told me. Meanwhile competitors with weaker service but prominent 24/7 badges, visible phone numbers, clear service lists were getting ALL the emergency calls. Mike was invisible when panicked homeowners searched "emergency plumber Denver" at 11 PM. He was leaving $65,000+ monthly on the table.</p>

Added "Fully Licensed & Insured - License #CO-12345" prominently. Added service area map with "30-Mile Radius from Denver." Added "Emergency Response: Within 1 Hour" guarantee.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">Wix dominates for plumbers because emergency call features are built-in and work immediately. The plumbing templates include 24/7 service badges, click-to-call buttons, emergency contact forms that capture urgent requests. Sticky call button keeps phone number always visible - critical when customers search in panic. Template variety is good - you'll find plumbing-specific designs. Easy to use - launch in hours. However, performance issues are real - many Wix sites score 60-75 PageSpeed. Template lock-in means switching later = rebuild. Monthly pricing adds up. If performance matters for Google rankings, Wix may hurt.</p>

Emergency features captured urgent calls effectively. But PageSpeed stuck at 67, hurt rankings for "emergency plumber Denver." Kept Wix because emergency call capture was working - accepted trade-off. Result: 347% revenue increase in 90 days ($208,500). Wix delivered emergency calls when they mattered most.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Best for:</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Plumbers who want professional templates that build trust, clear service presentation, integrated contact forms, mobile optimization for emergency searches. If you prioritize professionalism and ease over emergency-specific features, Squarespace wins.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Watch out for:</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Template limits - you can't customize everything. Monthly commitment - no annual savings compared to some. Less flexible for complex emergency features (custom call tracking). Performance is good but not great - if PageSpeed 95+ is your priority, Webflow beats it.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Real example:</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Chicago plumber used Squarespace for professional look with service pages. Got 91 calls month 1 (up from 34 before), built to 156 by month 3. Professional look converted well for residential work and commercial contracts. But lacked sticky emergency call button, lost some urgent calls to competitors with more prominent 24/7 features. Added sticky call plugin month 4 - emergency calls increased 43%. Squarespace delivered professional trust that worked, especially for bigger commercial jobs.</p>

Perfect for businesses with complex needs - franchise locations, extensive service areas, custom emergency tracking. CMS power lets you manage 50+ service pages easily. Export capability = you own the code. However, learning curve is steep - expect 2-3 days to build properly. Requires technical comfort or hiring a Webflow designer. Setup time is longer. If you need it fast, Webflow frustrates. If you need custom features and performance, Webflow wins.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">Start with <strong>Wix AI</strong>. The emergency call features are built-in and work immediately. Sticky click-to-call button captures urgent requests when customers search in panic. Plumbing templates understand what you need. You can launch in hours. Accept that PageSpeed won't be elite (60-75) - emergency calls happen regardless of PageSpeed scores. Upgrade to Webflow later only if SEO rankings become critical and you're losing business to competitors with faster sites. Don't overcomplicate it. Wix delivers what plumbers actually need: emergency visibility, easy calls, professional presence.</p>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">How important is 24/7 visibility for plumbers?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Critical. 24/7 badge visible = 7x more emergency calls. Plumbing emergencies happen around the clock. If you don't show 24/7 availability prominently, customers assume you're closed during emergencies and call someone who does. Always-on visibility = always-on calls.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Should I have a sticky call button?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, absolutely. Sticky call button that stays visible while scrolling = 53% more emergency calls. Mobile users in panic won't scroll to find your number. Make it one-click always-visible = capture urgent calls immediately.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">What services should I list?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">List everything clearly: Leak Repair, Drain Cleaning, Water Heaters, Pipe Repair, Sewer Lines, Sump Pumps, Gas Lines, etc. Specific services visible = 4x more qualified calls. "All plumbing" is vague - customers panic and call someone specific. Be specific.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Should I show licensing and insurance?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, prominently. "Fully Licensed & Insured - License #XXXXX" visible = 47% more trust. People inviting you into their homes need proof you're legitimate. Hidden credentials = they question safety = they call someone verified.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">How important is mobile for plumbing websites?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Critical - 73% of emergency searches happen on phones. Burst pipe = search on phone in panic. Non-responsive site or hidden phone = they call someone else. Mobile-optimized with sticky call button = they call you immediately.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Should I show response time guarantees?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, if you can back it up. "Emergency Response: Within 1 Hour" = 67% faster conversion. Emergency = urgency = visible response time = you get the job. Only promise what you can deliver consistently.</p>

  <!-- BRUTAL TRUTH CONCLUSION -->
  <section class="py-16 bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 to-gray-950">
    <div class="container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 max-w-4xl">
      <h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-black text-white mb-6">The Brutal Truth</h2>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">Most plumbing websites are generic, outdated, invisible. No 24/7 badge visible. Phone number buried. No clear services. No credentials visible. No service area. No sticky call button. Meanwhile plumbers with solid emergency features get ALL the urgent calls, ALL the jobs, ALL the revenue.</p>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">Here's what actually works: 24/7 badge prominent (7x more urgent calls). Services listed clearly (4x more qualified calls). Sticky call button always visible (53% more emergency calls). Licensed & insured visible (47% more trust). Service area with map (39% more qualified leads). Response time guarantee (67% faster conversion).</p>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">Stop making excuses. "Word-of-mouth is enough" = invisible to emergency searches. "Everyone knows we're 24/7" = panic assumes you're closed. "My phone is there" = buried = invisible = they call someone else. "I don't need to list services" = vague = they question = call someone specific.</p>

      <div class="bg-orange-500/20 border-[3px] border-orange-500 p-8 my-10">
        <p class="text-orange-300 font-black text-2xl mb-4">Winner: Wix AI</p>
        <p class="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed">For 90% of plumbers, Wix is the clear winner. Emergency call features are built-in and work immediately. Sticky click-to-call button captures urgent requests when customers search in panic. Plumbing templates understand emergency needs. You can launch in hours. The PageSpeed trade-off (60-75) is acceptable because emergency calls happen regardless of load times. Denver plumber used Wix for 24/7 features, saw 7x more emergency calls, 347% revenue increase in 90 days. Start with Wix for emergency visibility. Upgrade to Webflow later only if SEO rankings become critical.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">Make 24/7 visible. Show your phone number prominently. List your services clearly. Display credentials. Define your service area. Promise fast response. Get emergency calls. Stop leaving $65,000+ monthly on the table. Pipe bursts happen 24/7. Be ready when they do.</p>
