          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Luna Chen, vinyasa flow instructor in Austin (2023). Basic Wix site: logo, "About Me" page with 200-hour RYT certification only, generic "Class Schedule" page (PDF download, outdated March 2022), "Contact" form for bookings, no pricing visible. Weekly class attendance: 8-12 students (studio capacity: 25). Phone/text inquiries: 25/month asking "style?" "pricing?" "experience level?" (all answerable on site). Email inquiries: 18/month with basic questions. Incredible teaching ability (8 years practice, 500-hour RYT, studied in Mysore 2019), invisible teaching style. Monthly revenue: $2,400 (8 classes/week, $30/student avg). Competitors with visible styles booking 20-25 students/class. Luna working harder, teaching better, earning less.

              <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-1">"Vinyasa Flow Instructor" means nothing. "Mindful movement with breath-centered flow, emphasizing accessibility and body positivity, music-driven sequences inspired by modern flow, 8 years teaching experience" connects with students seeking exactly that style.

Competitor has beautiful teaching photos: demonstrating Warrior II with proper alignment, assisting student in Savasana, leading meditation. Students want to SEE your teaching before committing.

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-teal-600">YES. Transparency builds commitment.</strong> "Contact for pricing" loses 60% of students to transparent competitors. Show pricing clearly: "$25 drop-in, $100/5-class pack, $175 unlimited monthly." Include package discounts: "Save 20% with 5-class pack." Students budget for wellness. Hidden pricing = anxiety = bounce. Transparent pricing = trust = commitment. Your pricing isn't secret. Your competitor's is visible. Guess who gets the booking? Luna saw 31% more bookings month 1 just by showing pricing clearly.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-teal-600">Specific, descriptive philosophy prominently displayed.</strong> "Vinyasa Flow Instructor" is meaningless. "Mindful movement with breath-centered flow, emphasizing accessibility and body positivity, music-driven sequences inspired by modern flow, 8 years teaching experience" connects with students seeking exactly that style. Include teaching influences, approach to alignment, music preferences, class energy. Philosophy visible attracts aligned students who retain 67% better. Don't make students guess your style. Describe it clearly and they'll find you.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-teal-600">Yes, online booking reduces no-shows 28%.</strong> "Email to book" in 2025? Students want to INSTANTLY secure spots, especially popular evening classes. Online booking with payment capture = commitment. Email inquiries = 40% no-show rate. Online booking reduces no-shows to 12%. Booking integration (Mindbody, Acuity) costs $30-50/month. Lose 28% of revenue to save $30? Bad math. Online booking = commitment = attendance = revenue. Luna's no-show rate dropped from 38% to 14% with online booking.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-teal-600">Authentic teaching photos, not posed.</strong> Real teaching moments: demonstrating Warrior II with proper alignment, assisting student in Savasana, leading meditation, hands-on adjustments. Stock yoga poses = generic instructor. Real teaching photos = authentic expertise. Teaching photos build trust 5x more than logos. Include studio space photos (clean, welcoming). Luna's teaching photos increased bookings 5x month 1. Authenticity sells classes. Students want to see you TEACHING, not posing.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-teal-600">Very detailed with level and style specifics.</strong> "Vinyasa Flow" is useless. "Beginner-Friendly Flow: Perfect for new students, modifications provided for all poses, slower pace with detailed alignment instructions, room temperature 75°F, 60 minutes" attracts the right students. Include experience level, pace, temperature, music style, intensity. Level transparency = right students = better retention. 53% smoother bookings with levels visible. Luna saw fewer beginners leaving her advanced classes and fewer advanced students getting bored in beginner classes after adding level specifics.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-teal-600">YES, testimonials increase conversion 39%.</strong> Social proof matters. Include 10-20 testimonials with photos, full names, specific results: "I was terrified to try yoga, Luna's beginner-friendly class made me feel safe and supported, now I practice 3x weekly." Include transformation stories: "6 months later, I can do crow pose!" Photos of happy students build trust. Real testimonials = real results = book class. Luna's 17 testimonials increased conversion 39% month 1. Scared beginners need reassurance. Testimonials provide it.</p>

          <p class="text-white font-medium"><span class="text-teal-300 font-black">4.</span> No experience levels = wrong students.
