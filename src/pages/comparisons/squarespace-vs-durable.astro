        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A pest control company needed a site. Emergency service. Storm season was starting in 3 days. They couldn't wait weeks for a designer or hours for template browsing.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Durable:</strong> Generated in 29 seconds. "24/7 Emergency Pest Control" headline. Prominent phone number. Services page. Before/after gallery placeholder. Contact form with emergency checkbox. Built-in CRM captured leads with automatic follow-up reminders. Total time: 14 minutes. Published same day. First emergency call came next day.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Squarespace:</strong> Would've taken 2-4 hours minimum—choose template, customize, add content, set up forms. Days before feeling ready to publish. The design would've been more polished. But during those 3 days of storm season? They'd have lost emergency calls.</p>
          <div class="bg-amber-100 border-l-[4px] border-amber-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-amber-900 font-medium"><strong>3 months later:</strong> Durable site generated 247 leads. 34 became emergency clients. Average job value: $340. $11,560 in revenue from emergency calls they'd have missed while "perfecting" a Squarespace site.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The owner's take: "Could Squarespace look better? Sure. Would it be worth $11,560 in lost emergency revenue? No. Speed isn't a luxury when you're emergency services."</p>
          <div class="bg-orange-100 border-l-[4px] border-orange-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-orange-900 font-medium"><strong>The counterpoint:</strong> A high-end wedding photographer. Visuals ARE the product. Couples browse websites and book based on aesthetic quality. She spent 3 weeks crafting her Squarespace site. Every image, every font, every spacing choice intentional. Result? 47 bookings in year one, average $4,500 per wedding. $211,500 in revenue.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">If she'd used Durable? Generic design would've hurt her brand. Brides wouldn't trust their big day to someone with a template site. The 3-week investment in Squarespace paid for itself 20x over.</p>
          <div class="bg-red-100 border-l-[4px] border-red-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-red-900 font-medium"><strong>The truth:</strong> Durable for functional sites where speed matters more than aesthetics. Pest control, plumbers, emergency services—get online fast. Squarespace for design-led businesses where visual quality directly impacts sales. Photographers, restaurants, boutiques—invest in aesthetics. The pest control company made $11,560 from speed. The photographer made $211,500 from beauty. Both chose the right tool for their business.</p>
