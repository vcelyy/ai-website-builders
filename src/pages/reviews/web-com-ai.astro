    description: 'Inherited a Web.com client with a site from 2019. Client asked: "Can we just modernize this instead of rebuilding?" Spent 3 hours testing Web.com\'s modernization capabilities.',
    finding: 'Modernization is not possible within Web.com\'s platform. The templates available in 2024 are the same ones from 2019—same layouts, same boxy sections, same dated typography. Tried to "refresh" the site by switching templates: broke all custom content, had to rebuild from scratch. Tried to customize within template: limited options, kept hitting paywalls for basic features. Conclusion: you can\'t modernize a Web.com site. You rebuild elsewhere or accept the dated look. The legacy lock-in is real.'

    finding: 'Web.com is expensive for what you get. $20/mo gets you dated templates, basic AI, no code export. $30/mo still has the same issues. For comparison: Framer is $15-20/mo for premium design and code export. Squarespace is $16-23/mo for excellent templates. 10Web is $10-15/mo for WordPress power. Web.com\'s pricing is 2015-era for 2015-era features. The only justification: phone support and "we\'ve always used it" inertia. Otherwise, you\'re overpaying by 50%+.'

    title: 'AI Features Functionality Test',
    description: 'Tested Web.com\'s AI content generation for homepage copy, about page, and product descriptions. Compared quality against ChatGPT and competitor AI tools.',
    finding: 'Web.com\'s AI is basic but functional. Generated homepage copy: generic marketing speak, zero brand voice. "Welcome to our business. We provide excellent services." Usable but forgettable. Product descriptions: listed features but no persuasive language. Compared to ChatGPT with the same prompts: ChatGPT produced 3x better copy with personality. Compared to Wix AI: Wix understood context better, produced more natural language. Web.com\'s AI feels like tacked-on GPT-3, not integrated intelligence. It works but doesn\'t impress.'

    title: 'PageSpeed Performance Analysis',
    description: 'Built a test site on Web.com and ran Google PageSpeed Insights. Also tested loading speed with WebPageTest. Compared against budget competitors.',
    finding: 'Web.com sites are slow. Mobile PageSpeed: 52/100. Desktop: 68/100. Load time: 4.8 seconds. These are poor scores. The issue: bloated templates loading unnecessary scripts, unoptimized images, no lazy loading. For comparison, Hostinger AI (also budget) scored 65+ mobile. Framer scored 85+ mobile. If SEO matters, Web.com\'s poor performance will hurt you. The speed problem isn\'t fixable through optimization—it\'s baked into their template architecture.'

    title: 'Phone Support Quality Test',
    description: 'Called Web.com support 3 times with different issues: technical problem, billing question, and cancellation inquiry. Recorded wait times and resolution quality.',
    finding: 'Phone support is the one genuine strength. Call 1 (technical): 2-minute wait, agent was knowledgeable, resolved issue in 12 minutes. Call 2 (billing): 1-minute wait, agent clarified pricing without upsell. Call 3 (cancellation): 4-minute wait, agent processed it without fighting (rare!). The support is US-based, English-fluent, actually helpful. This is Web.com\'s moat: businesses that value phone support over everything else will tolerate the dated platform. If you need hand-holding and don\'t care about design quality, Web.com delivers.'

            <strong>US-based phone support:</strong> That's Web.com's selling point. Real humans in America you can call. If you value phone support over everything else, sure. But you'll pay $20-30/month for the privilege.

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Web.com has been around since 1997. They were one of the first website builders. Everyone's heard of them.

              Answer: Nothing. In fact, Wix does almost everything better.

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Web.com has been around since the 1990s. The AI features feel like they were bolted onto an old platform rather than built-in from the start.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The AI wizard asks questions and suggests a template. The AI content generator produces basic copy. It works, but lacks the sophistication of Durable, Framer, or even Wix.

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Web.com costs $20-30/month after the introductory period. This is similar to Wix and Squarespace - but you get less.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        For $16/month, Wix gives you better templates, more features, and stronger AI capabilities.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        For $15/month, Framer gives you modern designs, code export, and superior performance.

      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Web.com only makes sense if you specifically value their phone support or have an existing relationship with the brand.

              Small business owner was using Web.com at $28/month. Asked me to review their setup. I showed them Wix at $16/month with better templates, more features, and faster AI. They asked: "Why am I paying almost twice as much for less?" Good question. They switched to Wix, saved $144/year, got a better site. Web.com survives on brand recognition, not value.

              Tried Web.com's AI wizard. Asked it to generate a "modern minimalist portfolio for a UX designer." Got... a template from 2018 with stock photos of business people shaking hands. The AI is just template matching. No actual intelligence. Compare to Durable's AI that generates real content, or Framer's modern designs. Web.com's AI feels like a marketing checkbox, not a real feature.
