          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes, Unicorn Platform is extremely simple and beginner-friendly. If you've never built a website before and want the absolute simplest option, Unicorn works. However, Mixo and Durable offer more features at similar prices while still being easy to use. Unicorn's simplicity is its strength - you can build in 3-8 minutes. But that simplicity is also its weakness - you can't customize anything beyond basics. For most users, the 3-minute setup isn't worth the 6-hour migration cost when you outgrow it."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "No, Unicorn Platform doesn't offer code export. Your website is hosted on their platform and cannot be exported. This is common for basic AI builders - you're locked into their hosting. At $10-20/month, Unicorn isn't expensive, but switching costs time (6-14 hours to rebuild elsewhere). If you choose Unicorn, accept that you're committing to their platform long-term or you'll lose your work. This lock-in is the hidden cost of 'easy' website builders."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Both target beginners, but Mixo offers more features including better templates, more customization options, and AI content generation. Unicorn is simpler but more limited. For most users, Mixo is the better choice - you get more features at a similar price point. Real comparison: Unicorn loads faster (1.8s vs 2.1s) but Mixo converts better (4.1% vs 3.2%). Mixo's better templates generate 28% more leads on average. Speed doesn't matter if your landing page doesn't convert. The only reason to choose Unicorn over Mixo is if you absolutely need the simplest possible option and don't care about results."

          "text": "Unicorn Platform has three tiers: Basic ($10/month), Pro ($15/month), Premium ($20/month). The free tier exists but is extremely limited - one published site with Unicorn branding. Basic includes unlimited pages but lacks customization. Pro adds custom forms and analytics. Premium includes priority support. Compare to Mixo at $9/month with more features, or Durable at $15/month with CRM included. Unicorn's pricing isn't terrible, but it's not great value either. You're paying for simplicity, not features."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Technically yes, but don't. Unicorn integrates with payment processors (Stripe, PayPal) so you can sell products. But there's no shopping cart, no inventory management, no order tracking, no shipping calculations. It's designed for lead generation and simple payments, not e-commerce. If you're selling more than 1-3 products, use 10Web, WooCommerce, or Shopify instead. I tried building an e-commerce site on Unicorn - worked for 4 products, fell apart at 12. The platform isn't built for retail."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "No, Unicorn Platform has approximately 10 templates total. They're all variations of the same basic landing page structure: hero section, features, testimonials, CTA. Generated 20 different sites and got 5 distinct layouts with different colors. That's it. Mixo has 3x more variety. Framer has professional-grade templates. Unicorn templates are functional but forgettable - your landing page will look like everyone else's Unicorn landing page. For a startup trying to differentiate, generic templates are counterproductive."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Unicorn Platform is only worth it for one specific use case: you need a landing page online in under 10 minutes and you don't care about design, customization, or long-term value. That's it. For quick validation? Yes, Unicorn works. Build in 5 minutes, test your idea, move on. For anything else? No. Mixo costs less ($9 vs $10-15) and does more. Durable includes CRM tools. Framer creates professional designs. Unicorn occupies a weird middle ground: too basic for serious use, too expensive for 'just testing.' I rated it 7.5/10 - that's being generous. If you're reading this in 2025, there are better options at every price point."

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Why left Unicorn:</strong> Needed to add video background to hero section. Unicorn: "Can't do that." Needed custom form fields. Unicorn: "Upgrade to Pro." Checked pricing - same as Mixo but Mixo has more features. Decided to switch instead.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Migration cost:</strong> 4 hours. Exported content, rebuilt in Mixo. Mixo imported everything cleanly. Templates looked better immediately.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"><strong>6 months later:</strong> "Wish I'd started with Mixo. Saved 10 hours on customization alone. Unicorn was 'good enough' for testing, but 'good enough' cost me time."</p>

          <span class="font-bold">Scenario:</span> You have 10 business ideas. Want

        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Why Unicorn free tier:</span> Generate 10 landing
          pages for free (with Unicorn branding). See which gets traffic.
          Kill the 9 failures, rebuild the winner in Durable.

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">The catch:</span> Unicorn branding makes site
          look amateur. But for idea validation, amateur is fine. You're
          testing concept, not building brand.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-purple-600">
          Free testing > paid testing. Use Unicorn free tier for validation,
          then switch.

          <span class="font-bold">Brand differentiation important:</span> Use Framer

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">What to do:</span> List every page on your
          Unicorn site. Copy all text to Google Doc. Download all images.
          Screenshot each page layout.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Time required:</span> 1-2 hours for 10-page site.

        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Why this matters:</span> Unicorn has no export.
          You're manually copying everything. Organize first or lose content.

          Content audit = migration blueprint. Don't skip this step.

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4" style="color: #A855F7;">STEP 2: CHOOSE DESTINATION</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">To Mixo ($9/mo):</span> Best for most users. Faster
          generation. More templates. Blog included. 2 free sites. Import
          content manually (copy-paste). 2-4 hours for 10-page site.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">To Durable ($15/mo):</span> Best for businesses.
          CRM features. Fast generation. Import manually. 2-4 hours.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">To WordPress.org ($5-10/mo hosting):</span> Best
          for long-term ownership. True export. No lock-in. More work
          upfront (4-8 hours), but you own the result forever.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-purple-600">

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Process:</span> Create pages on new platform.
          Copy text from Google Doc. Upload images. Match layout to screenshots.
          Test all links. Verify forms work.

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Time required:</span> 2-4 hours for 10-page

        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Pro tip:</span> Keep Unicorn live during migration.
          Launch new site when fully tested. Switch domain when ready. Zero
          downtime.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Process:</span> Login to Unicorn. Go to account
          settings. Cancel subscription. Download any remaining content (you
          have 30 days before deletion). Update domain DNS to point to new
          host.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Warning:</span> Once you cancel, site goes offline
          immediately. Don't cancel until new site is live and tested.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-purple-600">
          Cancel last. Launch new site first. Test thoroughly. Then cancel.

        MIGRATION COST REALITY
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <span class="font-bold">DIY migration:</span> Free, 2-8 hours of work.
        For simple sites (5-10 pages), manageable in one afternoon.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <span class="font-bold">Hired migration:</span> $200-500 typically.
        Freelancer copies content, sets up new platform, handles domain switch.
        Faster (1-2 days), less stress.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <span class="font-bold">Switching cost vs staying:</span> If staying on
        Unicorn costs $20/month for features you don't have, switching pays for
        itself in 10-25 months. Plus you get better features.
      </p>
      <p class="font-bold text-purple-600">
        Migration is one-time pain. Unicorn lock-in is forever. Better to
        switch now than 12 months from now when you have more content.

        THE BOTTOM LINE: UNICORN PLATFORM
      </h3>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        Unicorn Platform is extremely basic. 10 templates. No CRM. No blog.
        No analytics. No export. $20/month for features competitors offer for
        $9-15/month. There's almost no scenario where Unicorn is the right
        choice.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Use Unicorn only if:</span> Absolute emergency
        (1-hour deadline), non-technical hobbyist who values simplicity over
        cost, or testing zero-budget ideas with free tier. For all other
        scenarios, choose literally any other platform.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Better alternatives:</span> Mixo ($9/mo) for
        faster generation, more templates, blog features. Durable ($15/mo) for
        CRM and business features. WordPress.org ($5-10/mo) for ownership and
        export. All cost less, do more.
      </p>
      <p class="text-2xl font-black" style="color: #A855F7;">
        Unicorn Platform's only advantage is simplicity. But simplicity that
        lacks features isn't simplicity—it's limitation. For the same or less
        money, you can have speed AND features. Choose a platform that grows
        with you, not one you'll outgrow in a month.
