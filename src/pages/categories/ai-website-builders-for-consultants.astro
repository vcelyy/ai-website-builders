              Consultant friend complained: "I'm better than competitors, but they get more inquiries." Checked her site: generic Squarespace template, stock photos of handshakes, vague claims "results-driven," no specific case studies. Checked competitor: custom design, real project photos, "increased Q4 revenue 47% for SaaS client," specific process breakdown. Same hourly rate. Guess who clients hire? Your site is your sales pitch. Generic template = commodity thinking.

Changed to specific case studies: "Helped SaaS startup reduce churn from 8% to 3.2% in 6 months," "Increased ecommerce conversion rate 47% for fashion brand." Month 1: qualified inquiries up 217%.

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-1">Consultant site filled with stock photos: diverse teams shaking hands, fake office settings, staged "meetings." Visitor feedback: "Feels fake. Can I trust them?" Replaced with: actual project screenshots, photos of real client teams (with permission), consultant's actual workspace. Authenticity builds trust.

Added pricing page: "Strategy consulting: $250/hour," "Project retainer: $8,000-15,000/month." Phone calls dropped 67%. Qualified inquiries increased 43%.

						<strong>Quick reality check:</strong> Consultants sell expertise and trust. Your website is where clients form first impressions of your competence. Template design, vague claims, stock photos, hidden pricing - all signal "commodity provider." Custom design, specific case studies, authentic photos, transparent pricing - signal "specialist who gets results." The difference is 3-5x more qualified inquiries.

					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>What actually matters for consultants</h2>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Case studies with numbers, not testimonials with praise</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Testimonials say "great to work with." Case studies say "increased revenue 47%." Clients hire results, not nice people. Best case studies: problem statement, your approach, specific outcome with numbers. "Helped SaaS startup reduce churn from 8% to 3.2% in 6 months" beats "excellent consultant who delivers results." One is specific. One is generic. Specific wins.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Specialization beats generalization every time</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					"Business consultant" = nobody knows what you do. "Marketing consultant for B2B SaaS" = clear expertise. "Operations consultant for manufacturing" = specific niche. Clients hire specialists, not generalists. I help everyone = I help no one. Narrow your focus. You can always expand later. Start specific.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Transparent pricing saves everyone time</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					"Call for pricing" sounds smart. Reality: you spend hours explaining pricing to people who can't afford you. List your rates. "$250/hour for strategy consulting," "$8,000-15,000/month for project retainer." Yes, some will sticker shock. Good. They weren't your clients anyway. Serious prospects know budget before calling. Everyone's time saved.

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Lead capture is essential, not optional</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Most visitors won't hire immediately. Capture emails. Newsletter, lead magnet, consultation booking. Build email list. Nurture relationships. When they're ready to hire, you're top of mind. Mixo and Durable have built-in lead capture. Framer integrates with email tools. Consultants: your email list is your business asset.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Booking integration = 24/7 sales</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Calendly, Acuity, Squarespace Bookings - integrate scheduling. Clients book consultations without phone tag. Calendar sync prevents double-booking. Automated reminders reduce no-shows. Durable has built-in CRM + booking. Wix has Wix Bookings. Framer integrates with Calendly. Make it easy for clients to say yes.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Blog demonstrates expertise, attracts leads</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Every consulting problem you solve = blog post. "How we reduced SaaS churn 47%," "5 operations mistakes growing manufacturers make." Content demonstrates expertise. SEO brings organic traffic. Email list captures leads. 10Web with WordPress is best here. Full CMS. SEO plugins. Blog to thought leadership pipeline.
