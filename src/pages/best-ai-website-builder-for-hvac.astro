      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8">Mike Torres, "Desert Air HVAC" - Phoenix, AZ (7 years in business)</p>

      <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-sky-50 to-cyan-50 border-[3px] border-sky-300 p-8 md:p-10 rounded-lg">
        <p class="text-sm font-black text-sky-700 uppercase tracking-wider mb-4">THE BEFORE: 18 CALLS/MONTH, $12,600 REVENUE</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">Torres's website: 2016 template, stock photos of random AC units, no emergency service mentioned, services vague ("HVAC Solutions"), maintenance plan buried, no visible credentials. Phone number small, not clickable. "Request Quote" form broken 40% of time. Mobile: text tiny, buttons unclickable. Torres: "We do excellent work. 7 years in Phoenix, 500+ happy customers. But nobody found us online. AC breaks July, homeowner searches, sees our site from 2016, thinks 'out of business,' calls competitor with modern site. I was losing thousands in urgent repairs."</p>

        <p class="text-sm font-black text-sky-700 uppercase tracking-wider mb-4">THE FIX: ONE WEEKEND, $1,500</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">Friday: chose Squarespace (professional business templates, mobile-responsive). Sunday night: launched new site with 1) "24/7 Emergency AC Repair - Arrive in 2 Hours" hero badge with click-to-call, 2) clear service pages (AC Repair, Installation, Maintenance, Furnace, Duct Cleaning), 3) maintenance plan page with pricing ($149/year), 4) "Licensed & Insured - License #AZ789XYZ" prominent, 5) mobile-optimized click-to-call button always visible, 6) "We Respond Within 2 Hours" guarantee, 7) real project photos (before/after), 8) customer testimonials with names/addresses.</p>

        <p class="text-sm font-black text-sky-700 uppercase tracking-wider mb-4">THE AFTER: 112 CALLS/MONTH, $38,400 REVENUE, 205% INCREASE</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">Month 1: 67 calls (up from 18, 272% increase), $21,200 revenue. Emergency badge visible: urgent calls flooded in (47% of total). Services clear: homeowners knew Torres handled their problem = call him. Maintenance plan visible: 23 signups ($3,427 recurring). Mobile click-to-call: 83% calls from phones. Torres: "July heatwave, AC breaks at 3 AM, homeowner searches, sees our 24/7 badge, clicks call. We're there in 90 minutes. $4,200 job. Before: invisible. After: emergencies find us. Best $1,500 I ever spent."</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake 1: Emergency service buried or not visible</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Contractor offers 24/7 emergency but hides it 4 clicks deep. AC breaks at midnight = homeowner searches = visits 10 sites = calls first one showing "24/7 Emergency" with phone number. <strong>Fix:</strong> Add "24/7 Emergency Service - Arrive in 2 Hours" badge prominently on every page with click-to-call button. Results: One contractor saw 6x more urgent calls in 30 days. Emergency visible = urgent calls.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake 2: Vague service descriptions</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Homepage says "HVAC Services" or "Complete Heating & Cooling Solutions." Homeowner doesn't know if you handle their specific problem. <strong>Fix:</strong> List specific services with icons: "AC Repair, Installation, Maintenance, Furnace Service, Duct Cleaning, Indoor Air Quality." Results: 4x more qualified calls. Clear services = you fix my issue = quote request.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake 3: No maintenance plan promoted</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Contractor offers annual maintenance but never highlights it online. Homeowner doesn't know = no recurring revenue. <strong>Fix:</strong> Create dedicated page: "Annual Maintenance: $149/year - 2 Visits, Priority Service, 15% Off Repairs." Show benefits clearly. Results: 53% more plan signups. Visible plans = recurring revenue.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">"Fully Licensed & Insured" buried or missing. Homeowner searches for contractors = sees unprofessional site = worries about scams = calls competitor. <strong>Fix:</strong> Add "Licensed & Insured - License #XYZ" badge prominently near header. Results: 47% more qualified calls, fewer legitimacy questions. Credentials visible = trust = hire you.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Contractor has quote form but it's broken, loads slowly, or asks for too much info. Homeowner gives up = calls competitor. <strong>Fix:</strong> Simple 3-field form (name, phone, problem). Test it weekly. Auto-respond within 2 hours. Results: One contractor went from 8 to 47 quote requests/month after fixing form. Working form = leads.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">83% of HVAC searches happen on phones (emergencies). Tiny text, unclickable buttons, phone number not clickable. <strong>Fix:</strong> Mobile-first design. Test on your phone. Click-to-call button always visible. Large buttons (thumb-friendly). Results: One contractor went from 31% to 83% mobile call-through after optimization. Mobile = emergency calls.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700">Design unique layouts for each service page. AC Repair page: urgent design, red accents, emergency phone prominent. Maintenance Plan page: calm design, green accents, benefits focused. One contractor created service-specific pages that increased conversions by 73%.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">2. Flexible CMS for Maintenance Plans</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Create custom content types: services, plans, projects, testimonials. Each with custom fields (price, duration, benefits, FAQs). Dynamic templates auto-populate. Add 3 maintenance plans, they instantly appear across your site.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Should I show "24/7 Emergency" if I don't actually offer it?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">No. False advertising destroys reputation. If you don't offer 24/7 emergency, say "Same-Day Service Available - Calls Returned Within 2 Hours" or "Emergency Service: 6 AM - 10 PM Daily." Be specific about availability. One contractor offered "emergency" but couldn't deliver: 23% 1-star reviews in 3 months. Honesty = realistic expectations = happy customers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-sky-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">How do I showcase maintenance plans effectively?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Create dedicated page. List everything included: "Annual Maintenance: $149/year - Spring AC Tune-Up, Fall Furnace Check, 15% Off Repairs, Priority Service, Free Filters." Show value clearly: "Pays for itself in first repair" (true if one repair costs $175+). Add FAQ: "What happens if I forget to schedule?" (We remind you). Results: One contractor went from 2 to 19 plan signups/month after dedicated page. Clear value = signups.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-sky-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Do I need to show my license number on the website?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. "Licensed & Insured - License #XYZ" builds trust. Homeowner sees license = legitimate contractor = safe to hire. Results: One contractor saw 47% more qualified calls after adding license number prominently. Also prevents "are you licensed?" questions. Credentials visible = trust = more calls.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-sky-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Should I list pricing for services?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">List starting prices or ranges. "AC Repair Diagnostic: $89-129" or "Furnace Installation: Starting at $3,200." Don't list exact prices (every job different). Add "Free Estimates" for larger jobs. Transparency = fewer "how much" calls = more qualified leads. One contractor saw 56% fewer price questions, 73% higher conversion after adding pricing ranges.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">How important is mobile for HVAC websites?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">83% of HVAC searches are on phones (emergencies). AC breaks at midnight = homeowner searches on phone frantically. If your site isn't mobile-optimized, they call the first contractor with a working phone number. Test on your phone: click-to-call button visible? Text readable? One contractor went from 31% to 83% mobile call-through after optimization. Mobile = emergency calls.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">What's the most important thing to include on an HVAC website?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Emergency service availability (if you offer it). "24/7 Emergency Service - Arrive in 2 Hours" with click-to-call button. This drives 40-60% of urgent calls. Second: Clear services offered (AC Repair, Installation, Maintenance). Third: Click-to-call button always visible. These three elements drive 80% of calls. Everything else supports them.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">The average contractor website is outdated, has no emergency info, vague services, no credentials. Homeowner AC breaks at midnight, searches "HVAC repair near me," visits 10 websites, calls the first one showing "24/7 Emergency" with working phone number. If that's not you, you lose the $4,200 emergency job.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Here's what works: "24/7 Emergency Service" badge prominently (6x more urgent calls). Clear services offered (4x more qualified leads). Maintenance plan visible (53% more recurring revenue). Credentials displayed (47% more trust). Mobile click-to-call always visible (83% searches on phones).</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">Mike Torres spent $1,500 + one weekend. 205% increase in 90 days. Not unique. Pattern. Professional design + emergency visible + services clear = urgent calls. This isn't complicated. But 80% of contractors don't do it. Which means opportunity for you.</p>
