          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">1. Partial Portfolio = Partial Interest</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2"><strong>The trap:</strong> "Featured Wines" shows top 12, that's enough.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2"><strong>Reality:</strong> Restaurant wine director might need your $18 Grüner for by-the-glass, not your $72 Pinot featured. Importers with full portfolios get 5x more inquiries. Categorize by region, grape, price - make it browsable. Hidden wines = lost sales.</p>
          <p class="text-violet-700 font-black">Complete portfolio = full sales opportunities. Every wine has a buyer.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2"><strong>The trap:</strong> "Wine names speak for themselves."</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2"><strong>Reality:</strong> "Crisp white wine" is useless. "Crisp acidity with notes of grapefruit and lemongrass, mineral finish, pairs with oysters" sells wine. Wine directors need language to sell to guests. Detailed tasting notes increase buyer confidence 67%.</p>
          <p class="text-violet-700 font-black">Your wines have character. Describe it or lose the sale.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2"><strong>Reality:</strong> PDF from February 2022? Current January 2025. Pricing changed, wines discontinued, new arrivals not listed. Wine directors assume you're not active. Real-time availability = accuracy = trust. 73% of buyers won't inquire if pricing isn't current.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2"><strong>Reality:</strong> "Our portfolio" means nothing. "Third-generation vigneron Jean-Pierre, biodynamic since 2008, 70-year-old vines, native yeast" means EVERYTHING. Stories justify premium. Importers with winemaker stories sell 53% more premium placements.</p>

        <p class="text-violet-200 text-lg mb-6">Here's what actually happens when wine directors search for suppliers—and why 95% of importers are leaving money on the table.</p>

        <div class="space-y-5">
          <div class="bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/20 p-5 rounded-lg">
            <p class="text-white font-black text-lg mb-2">Reality #1: Partial Portfolios Lose Sales</p>
            <p class="text-violet-100">Restaurant wine director needs a $18 Grüner for by-the-glass program. Your site shows top 12 wines only, all $50+. They assume you don't have what they need and move to competitor who shows full 100-wine portfolio. Importers with complete portfolios get 5x more inquiries. Hidden wines = lost sales = lost placements. Every wine has a buyer. Show them all.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/20 p-5 rounded-lg">
            <p class="text-white font-black text-lg mb-2">Reality #2: No Tasting Notes = No Buyer Confidence</p>
            <p class="text-violet-100">Wine directors need language to sell wine to guests. "Crisp white wine" gives them nothing to work with. "Crisp acidity with notes of grapefruit and lemongrass, mineral finish, pairs perfectly with oysters" gives them a sales script. Detailed tasting notes increase buyer confidence 67%. Your wines have character. Describe it or buyers won't take the risk.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/20 p-5 rounded-lg">
            <p class="text-white font-black text-lg mb-2">Reality #3: PDF Price Lists Are Outdated Before Download</p>
            <p class="text-violet-100">Downloadable PDF from February 2022? Current date January 2025. Three years of price changes, discontinued wines, new arrivals not reflected. Wine directors see outdated PDF and assume you're not active in the market. Real-time availability = accuracy = trust. 73% of buyers won't inquire if pricing isn't current. Live inventory beats PDF every time.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/20 p-5 rounded-lg">
            <p class="text-white font-black text-lg mb-2">Reality #4: No Winemaker Stories = No Premium Pricing</p>
            <p class="text-violet-100">"Our portfolio" means nothing. "Third-generation vigneron Jean-Pierre Martin, vines planted 1952, biodynamic since 2008, hand-harvested, native yeast fermentation, aged 18 months in neutral French oak" justifies $72/bottle pricing. Stories create value. Importers with winemaker stories sell 53% more premium placements. Your wines have history. Tell it prominently.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/20 p-5 rounded-lg">
            <p class="text-white font-black text-lg mb-2">Reality #5: Mobile Optimization is Essential</p>
            <p class="text-violet-100">Wine directors browse portfolios BETWEEN SERVICES on phones. 79% of wine sourcing happens on mobile - 11PM after dinner service, 8AM before prep. Desktop-only site = invisible during prime buying time. Tiny text, broken layouts, impossible inquiry forms = they bounce to mobile-optimized competitors. Non-responsive sites lose 60% of traffic.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/20 p-5 rounded-lg">
            <p class="text-white font-black text-lg mb-2">Reality #6: No Trade Portal = Lost Accounts</p>
            <p class="text-violet-100">"Email us for pricing" loses accounts to competitors with online ordering. Restaurant buyers work weird hours. They want SELF-SERVICE: browse portfolio, check pricing, submit inquiry - at 11PM after service. Email chains waste time. Trade portals with online inquiries increase conversions 43%. Your competition has online ordering. You lose accounts without it.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="mt-8 p-6 bg-white/10 border border-white/30 rounded-lg">
          <p class="text-white font-black text-xl mb-3">The Reality Check:</p>
          <p class="text-violet-100 mb-3">I see wine importers with incredible portfolios, terrible websites. Top 12 wines only, no tasting notes, outdated PDFs, "email for pricing." Then I see importers with decent wines, stunning websites. Full portfolios, detailed notes, real-time pricing, online ordering. Guess who gets the placements?</p>
          <p class="text-violet-100 mb-3">James's natural wines didn't change. His visibility did. 8-month transformation: $12,000/month to $47,000/month. Same wines, different presentation. Your wines deserve to be seen. Your website is your 24/7 portfolio catalog. Make every bottle discoverable.</p>
          <p class="text-violet-300 font-black text-lg">The brutal truth: Invisible portfolio = no placements. Visible wines = quality selection = stock your list. Your website is the difference between being the best-kept secret and being fully booked.</p>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-violet-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should wine importers show full portfolio online?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">YES. Complete portfolio = full sales opportunities. "Featured Wines" shows 12 selections. Restaurant wine director might need your $18 Grüner for by-the-glass program, not your $72 Pinot featured. Importers with full portfolios get 5x more inquiries. Categorize by region, grape, price - make it browsable. Hidden wines = lost sales. Your entire portfolio should be visible, searchable, with current availability. Every wine has a buyer. Show them all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-violet-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How detailed should tasting notes be?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Very detailed with selling points included. "Crisp white wine" is useless. "Crisp acidity with notes of grapefruit and lemongrass, mineral finish from limestone soils, pairs perfectly with oysters, raw bar, goat cheese salads" sells wine. Include flavor profile, structure, food pairings, service suggestions. Wine directors need language to sell to guests. Detailed notes increase buyer confidence 67%. Your wines have character. Describe it.</p>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-violet-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Do wine importers need online trade portals?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, trade portals increase conversions 43%. Restaurant buyers work weird hours - 11PM after service, 8AM before prep. They want to SELF-SERVICE: browse portfolio, check pricing, submit inquiry when inspiration strikes. Email chains waste time. Online trade inquiry forms with account applications capture details automatically. Portals with real-time availability = instant answers = faster orders. Your competition has online ordering. You lose accounts without it.</p>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-violet-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How do importers show winemaker stories?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Dedicated producer profile pages with specifics. "Family-owned winery" means nothing. "Third-generation vigneron Jean-Pierre Martin, vines planted 1952, biodynamic since 2008, hand-harvested, native yeast fermentation, aged in neutral French oak 18 months" justifies premium pricing. Include photos of vineyards, winemakers, production methods. Importers with winemaker stories sell 53% more premium placements. Your wines have history. Tell it prominently.</p>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-violet-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should importers show pricing on websites?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">YES, transparent trade pricing is essential. "Contact for pricing" loses 73% of buyers to transparent competitors. Show case pricing clearly: "$180/case, $15/bottle." Include tier discounts: "10+ cases: 5% off, 25+ cases: 10% off." Wholesale pricing visible = buyers know budget = can order. Your pricing isn't secret. Your competitor's is visible. Guess who gets the order? Transparent pricing = trust = trade accounts.</p>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-violet-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How important is age verification?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Legally required and non-negotiable. Wine shipping laws require age verification - 21+ in US, provincial requirements in Canada, varying rules internationally. Implement age gates on site entry AND checkout. Shopify, Squarespace, Webflow all have age verification apps/plugins (many free). Non-compliant = legal liability. Age verification protects your business. Every importer needs this. Period.</p>
