          "text": "Webflow (8.5/10) and Relume (8.2/10) are very close overall and both have excellent design quality (9.0/10 each). However, they serve different purposes and can actually work together. Webflow is a complete visual CMS and website builder with hosting, powerful CMS features (9.5/10 flexibility), and code export. Relume is a Figma plugin that generates sitemaps and wireframes that can export directly to Webflow. Webflow is better if you want a complete website builder with maximum control and powerful CMS. Relume is better if you're a designer working in Figma who wants AI-assisted sitemap generation and wireframing before exporting to Webflow. These are complementary tools, not direct competitors - many designers use Relume for planning in Figma, then export to Webflow for development and hosting."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Webflow and Relume have different pricing models reflecting their different purposes. Webflow starts at $15/month for basic sites, $29/month for CMS features, up to $59/month for advanced plans with more CMS items and form submissions. Over 3 years, Webflow costs $540-2128 depending on plan level. Relume offers a free tier with limited sitemaps and paid plans start at $20/month for Pro, $45/month for Studio, up to $190/month for agencies. Over 3 years, Relume costs $720-6840 depending on plan level. However, many designers use both together - Relume for planning (often starting with free tier), then Webflow for hosting and development. If comparing for complete website building, Webflow includes hosting and is a complete solution. Relume is a design tool that requires Webflow or another platform for finished websites."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Webflow and Relume work together as complementary tools in a professional design workflow. Relume runs as a plugin within Figma, where you use AI to generate sitemaps and wireframe components. After designing in Figma with Relume, you export directly to Webflow using Relume's Webflow export feature. Webflow then becomes your development and hosting platform where you refine designs, add CMS functionality, and launch your website. This workflow is: (1) Use Relume in Figma for rapid sitemap generation and wireframing, (2) Design and refine in Figma, (3) Export to Webflow, (4) Develop and host in Webflow. This combines Relume's AI-assisted planning with Webflow's powerful CMS and hosting."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes, Relume requires Figma to function. Relume is a Figma plugin - it doesn't work as a standalone tool. You must have a Figma account (free or paid) to use Relume. This is fundamentally different from Webflow, which is a complete standalone platform. If you don't use Figma or prefer not to work in Figma, Relume won't work for you. Webflow doesn't require Figma or any external tools - it's self-contained. For designers who live in Figma, Relume is natural and powerful. For those who don't use Figma, Webflow is the better choice. This is the most important decision factor: if Figma is part of your workflow, Relume + Webflow is powerful. If not, Webflow alone is the right path."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "No, Relume cannot replace Webflow. Relume is a design and planning tool that outputs sitemaps and wireframes - it doesn't host websites, provide CMS functionality, or publish to the web. Relume exports to Webflow (and other platforms), but you still need Webflow or another platform to actually build and host your website. Think of Relume as planning/architecture phase and Webflow as construction/development phase. Relume helps you plan what to build. Webflow is where you actually build it. You can use Webflow without Relume (many designers do). You cannot use Relume alone for a complete website - it needs a platform like Webflow to finish the job. Relume accelerates planning, Webflow handles everything else."

        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Is Webflow harder to learn than Relume?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Webflow has a steeper learning curve (7.0/10 ease) compared to Relume (7.5/10 ease), but they teach different skills. Webflow requires learning: visual CSS concepts, the Webflow interface, CMS structure, interactions and animations, responsive design patterns, hosting and publishing. Relume requires learning: Figma basics (if you don't know them), Relume's sitemap builder, component library usage, export to Webflow workflow. Both take time to master. Webflow skills are universally valuable - any visual design or development work benefits from understanding Webflow's approach. Relume skills are specific to Figma-based workflows. For beginners, Webflow's learning curve is more challenging but more broadly applicable. Relume is easier if you already know Figma, but useless if you don't."

        "name": "Which is better for client work?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "For professional client work, using both Relume + Webflow is often the best approach. Here's why: Relume lets you rapidly generate sitemaps with client in meetings - get instant feedback on structure, show visual hierarchy, iterate in real-time. Clients love seeing the sitemap planning process - it feels professional and thorough. After approval, export to Webflow for development. Webflow handles: CMS development, client handoff, hosting and maintenance, future scalability. Real agency example: 2-hour Relume planning session + 12-day Webflow build won a $38,000 contract. Competitor bid 6 weeks at $45,000. The structured sitemap presentation was the clinician. For simple client sites under 10 pages, Webflow alone is sufficient. For complex sites (20+ pages) or when client approval matters, Relume + Webflow wins."

        <li><strong>Webflow is better for:</strong> Complete website development, powerful CMS needs, designers who don't use Figma, standalone projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Relume is better for:</strong> Figma-based workflows, agency teams, rapid prototyping, Webflow users wanting speed.</li>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Important: Complementary, Not Competing</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Webflow and Relume are complementary tools, not direct competitors. Relume was specifically built to integrate with Webflow - it's a Figma plugin that exports to Webflow. Many professional designers use both: Relume for AI-assisted sitemap generation and wireframing in Figma, then Webflow for development, CMS, and hosting. Choosing between them isn't necessary - you can use both for a faster professional workflow. If budget forces a choice, Webflow is the complete solution. Relume requires Webflow or another platform for finished websites.

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A design agency was pitching a SaaS client. Competitor bid: 6 weeks, $45,000. Agency had to beat that.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Traditional Webflow approach:</strong> Start from blank canvas. Design each page. Build CMS structure. Create responsive layouts. Previous projects like this took 4-6 weeks.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Relume + Webflow approach:</strong> Opened Relume in Figma. Generated sitemap with AI - 28 pages organized in 3 minutes. Client reviewed, requested changes. Made iterations in real-time meeting. Client approved structure. Exported to Webflow. Built entire site in 12 days. Total planning time: 2 hours. Total build time: 12 days.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-red-900 font-medium"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> Agency won the contract at $38,000 (delivered in 2 weeks vs competitor's 6 weeks). Client was impressed by the structured sitemap presentation - nobody else showed that level of planning.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-orange-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Relume doesn't replace Webflow - it supercharges it. For complex sites (20+ pages), 2 hours of Relume planning saves 2+ weeks of Webflow development. For simple sites (5-10 pages), just use Webflow directly - Relume is overkill.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The framework:</strong> Use Relume + Webflow for client work, complex projects, when client approval on structure matters. Use Webflow alone for personal projects, simple sites, when you know exactly what you're building.</p>

    <div class="space-y-6">
      <div class="border-l-4 border-rose-500 pl-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Is Webflow or Relume better for website building?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">Webflow (8.5/10) and Relume (8.2/10) are very close overall and both have excellent design quality (9.0/10 each). However, they serve different purposes and can actually work together. Webflow is a complete visual CMS and website builder with hosting, powerful CMS features (9.5/10 flexibility), and code export. Relume is a Figma plugin that generates sitemaps and wireframes that can export directly to Webflow. These are complementary tools, not direct competitors - many designers use Relume for planning in Figma, then export to Webflow for development and hosting.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="border-l-4 border-rose-500 pl-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What is the price difference between Webflow and Relume?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">Webflow and Relume have different pricing models reflecting their different purposes. Webflow starts at $15/month for basic sites, $29/month for CMS features, up to $59/month for advanced plans. Over 3 years, Webflow costs $540-2128 depending on plan level. Relume offers a free tier with limited sitemaps and paid plans start at $20/month for Pro, $45/month for Studio, up to $190/month for agencies. Over 3 years, Relume costs $720-6840 depending on plan level. However, many designers use both together - Relume for planning (often starting with free tier), then Webflow for hosting and development.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="border-l-4 border-rose-500 pl-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How do Webflow and Relume work together?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">Webflow and Relume work together as complementary tools in a professional design workflow. Relume runs as a plugin within Figma, where you use AI to generate sitemaps and wireframe components. After designing in Figma with Relume, you export directly to Webflow using Relume's Webflow export feature. Webflow then becomes your development and hosting platform where you refine designs, add CMS functionality, and launch your website. This workflow combines Relume's AI-assisted planning with Webflow's powerful CMS and hosting.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="border-l-4 border-rose-500 pl-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Do I need Figma to use Relume?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">Yes, Relume requires Figma to function. Relume is a Figma plugin - it doesn't work as a standalone tool. You must have a Figma account (free or paid) to use Relume. This is fundamentally different from Webflow, which is a complete standalone platform. If you don't use Figma or prefer not to work in Figma, Relume won't work for you. Webflow doesn't require Figma or any external tools - it's self-contained. For designers who live in Figma, Relume is natural and powerful. For those who don't use Figma, Webflow is the better choice.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="border-l-4 border-rose-500 pl-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Can Relume replace Webflow?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">No, Relume cannot replace Webflow. Relume is a design and planning tool that outputs sitemaps and wireframes - it doesn't host websites, provide CMS functionality, or publish to the web. Relume exports to Webflow (and other platforms), but you still need Webflow or another platform to actually build and host your website. Think of Relume as planning/architecture phase and Webflow as construction/development phase. Relume helps you plan what to build. Webflow is where you actually build it. You can use Webflow without Relume. You cannot use Relume alone for a complete website.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="border-l-4 border-rose-500 pl-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Is Webflow harder to learn than Relume?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">Webflow has a steeper learning curve (7.0/10 ease) compared to Relume (7.5/10 ease), but they teach different skills. Webflow requires learning: visual CSS concepts, the Webflow interface, CMS structure, interactions and animations, responsive design patterns, hosting and publishing. Relume requires learning: Figma basics (if you don't know them), Relume's sitemap builder, component library usage, export to Webflow workflow. Both take time to master. Webflow skills are universally valuable - any visual design or development work benefits from understanding Webflow's approach.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="border-l-4 border-rose-500 pl-6">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Which is better for client work?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600">For professional client work, using both Relume + Webflow is often the best approach. Relume lets you rapidly generate sitemaps with client in meetings - get instant feedback on structure, show visual hierarchy, iterate in real-time. Clients love seeing the sitemap planning process - it feels professional and thorough. After approval, export to Webflow for development. Real agency example: 2-hour Relume planning session + 12-day Webflow build won a $38,000 contract. Competitor bid 6 weeks at $45,000. The structured sitemap presentation was the clincher.</p>

Relume: component library only, requires Webflow CMS for content sites. For content-heavy projects (magazines, portfolios, blogs)—Webflow's native CMS manages everything without external tools.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Magazine with 1000+ articles. Webflow CMS: structured content, author profiles, categories, search. Relume: provides page layouts but CMS management requires manual Webflow setup anyway. Native CMS = time saved.</p>
