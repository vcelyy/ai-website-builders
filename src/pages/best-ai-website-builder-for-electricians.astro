          <p class="text-sm font-black text-gray-600 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE: 18 CALLS/MONTH, $15,000 REVENUE, INVISIBLE EMERGENCY CONTRACTOR</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Mike Rodriguez runs Rodriguez Electric in Seattle. 15 years experience, master electrician, excellent reputation. Website: outdated 2018 template, "Electrical Services" vague, emergency contact buried on contact page, mobile site difficult to navigate. Result: 18 calls/month, $15,000 revenue, mostly repeat customers. Problem: power outages happen = homeowners search emergency electrician = never find Rodriguez. Competitors with modern sites get the calls. Rodriguez: "I'm the best electrician in Seattle, but nobody knows when they need emergency help. My website looks like I went out of business in 2019."</p>

Total investment: $2,900 (Wix subscription for 1 year). Build time: 4 days. Rodriguez: "I focused on emergency visibility. When power's out, people don't research - they call whoever shows available first."</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Month 1 results: 42 emergency calls (up from 18, 133% increase), $28,000 revenue. Google ranking: page 1 position 2 for "emergency electrician Seattle." Emergency visible: homeowners call Rodriguez first when power's out. Licensed insured visible: trust = safe contractor = hire. Services clear: customers call for specific projects Rodriguez actually does. Mobile call button: 89% of emergency searches on phones = click call = instant business. Service areas: customers know Rodriguez serves their area = call instead of scrolling. Rodriguez: "Professional website = legitimate electrician = trust = calls. Before: invisible despite excellent work. After: emergency visible = they call me first = business. Best $2,900 I ever spent." Month 3: 62 calls/month, $52,000 revenue. Investment: $2,900.

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake #1: Burying emergency service</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Electrician adds "we offer emergency service" on contact page. Result: nobody sees it. Power outage = search = visit your site = don't see emergency = call competitor. Fix: Add "24/7 Emergency Electrical" to hero with phone prominent. Emergency visible first impression = they call you.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Site lists "electrical services" without specifics. Customer searching "panel upgrade electrician" - does Rodriguez do that? Unclear = they call competitor. Fix: List services explicitly: "Rewiring, Panel Upgrades, EV Charger Installation, Generator Install." Specific services = they call you for their project.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-red-500 pl-6 py-5 bg-red-50/50 rounded-r">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake #3: Hidden licensing credentials</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Electrician mentions "licensed & insured" in footer text. Result: customers miss it, doubt legitimacy, call competitor who displays credentials prominently. Fix: Add "License #ELEC-98765 | Fully Licensed & Insured" near hero. Credentials visible = legitimate = safe = hire you.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Site requires 3 clicks to find phone number. Power outage = customer on phone = can't easily call = click back = call competitor. Fix: Add one-click "Call Now" button sticky in header always visible. Easy call = emergency business.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-red-500 pl-6 py-5 bg-red-50/50 rounded-r">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake #5: No service areas listed</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Contractor serves 5 counties but doesn't list them. Customer searching "electrician near Tacoma" - not sure if Rodriguez serves there = calls competitor who lists service areas. Fix: Add "Serving: Seattle, Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland" prominently. Service areas visible = you serve my area = I call you.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Website looks like 2015 template. Customer: "if this site's outdated, maybe they're not in business anymore or don't care."

          <p class="text-gray-700">Wix AI. Rodriguez: "I added '24/7 Emergency Electrical' with phone to hero in 5 minutes. No coding, drag-and-drop." Emergency visible day one = calls day one. Build time: 2-4 hours total.</p>
