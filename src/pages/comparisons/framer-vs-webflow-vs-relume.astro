          <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
          <div class="space-y-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Eighteen months ago, a B2B SaaS company hired me to build their marketing site. 25 pages needed: features, pricing, case studies, blog, docs preview, integrations, careers, about, contact. Old workflow: open Framer, start building, realize structure is wrong halfway through, rebuild, waste weeks. New workflow: plan with Relume first.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Relume phase (90 minutes, free):</strong> Created account, entered project details ("B2B project management SaaS"), clicked generate. AI created complete sitemap with 27 pages (we'd only planned 24). Stakeholders reviewed—we caught 3 missing pages before writing a single line of code. Restructured user flow based on feedback. Created wireframes for every page with proper hierarchy. Generated page flows showing user journeys. All in 90 minutes. Previous project: 3 weeks of planning meetings, still missed pages.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Framer phase (2 weeks, $15/month):</strong> Exported wireframes directly to Framer (one click). Built actual designs with AI assistance—typed "modern SaaS hero section with gradient background" and got 80% there. Custom branded each page with company colors. Added scroll animations, hover effects, micro-interactions. Integrated with their existing CMS (Contentful). Launched on day 16. Client thrilled with speed and quality.</p>

            <div class="bg-indigo-100 border-l-[4px] border-indigo-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p class="text-sm text-indigo-900 font-medium"><strong>The results:</strong> Site launched in 16 days total. Zero restructures. Zero "we should have planned this better" moments. First month: 12,400 visitors, 484 trial signups, 42 converted to paid customers. Average plan: $297/month. $12,468 in first-month revenue. Paid for the entire project 8x over.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bg-violet-100 border-l-[4px] border-violet-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p class="text-sm text-violet-900 font-medium"><strong>The comparison:</strong> Previous similar project (before Relume): 5 weeks total. Spent 2 weeks rebuilding because we missed critical pages in initial planning. Launched late. Competitor launched first, captured market share. Lost opportunity cost: estimated $40,000 in first-quarter revenue.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>When did Webflow enter the picture?</strong></p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Six months post-launch, the SaaS company scaled rapidly. Hit 500 paying customers. Marketing team wanted to expand docs (200+ articles), add user forum, build knowledge base with custom filtering, create customer success portal. Framer CMS started creaking—collection limits hit, filtering became slow, client editing was clunky.</p>

            <div class="bg-purple-100 border-l-[4px] border-purple-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p class="text-sm text-purple-900 font-medium"><strong>The migration (3 weeks, $45/month Webflow):</strong> Because we'd planned with Relume from day one, the site structure was solid. Migration to Webflow was straightforward—moved CMS collections, rebuilt templates in Webflow, set up client editing access. Webflow handled 200+ doc articles with ease. Custom filtering worked perfectly. Client could edit content without developer help.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bg-fuchsia-100 border-l-[4px] border-fuchsia-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p class="text-sm text-fuchsia-900 font-medium"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> Start with Relume for planning (free tier is legit). Build in Framer for speed and design quality ($15-25/mo). Scale to Webflow when you outgrow Framer's CMS ($18+/mo). This is the professional workflow that scales with your project. Don't skip the planning step—90 minutes in Relume saves 2 weeks of rework.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The lesson:</strong> I've used this workflow on 15+ projects now. Every single time: faster launches, fewer reworks, happier clients, better results. Planning with Relume prevents the "build twice" problem. Building in Framer maximizes design quality and speed. Scaling to Webflow happens naturally when needed. The tools aren't competitors—they're a pipeline.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The SaaS company? Still on Webflow today. Docs expanded to 347 articles. Forum has 2,400 active users. Knowledge base gets 45,000 views/month. Revenue grew to $127,000/month. All started with 90 minutes of planning in Relume.</p>

      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Here's what most people miss: Framer, Webflow, and Relume aren't competing. They solve different problems in the design process. Relume plans. Framer builds. Webflow scales. Smart designers use all three in sequence.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>The workflow:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Relume AI:</strong> Generate sitemap and wireframes (free!). Validate structure with stakeholders. Export to Framer or Webflow.</li>
        <li><strong>Framer AI:</strong> Build the actual site quickly. Use AI generation for speed. Customize with drag-drop editing. Add animations and polish.</li>
        <li><strong>Webflow:</strong> Migrate if/when you need complex CMS, e-commerce, or client handoff features. This might be never—many sites stay in Framer forever.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        For the 25-page SaaS site, Relume provided the structure (90 minutes), Framer built the design (2 weeks), and Webflow handled the scale-up 6 months later (3 weeks). Total workflow: 16 days to launch + 3 weeks migration = 5 weeks total vs. 5+ weeks the old way with worse results.

        <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Design quality: Framer and Webflow tie
      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Framer:</strong> Best-in-class for modern, beautiful designs. The component system is intuitive. Animations are smooth and easy. Templates look like 2025, not 2015. For portfolios and marketing sites, nothing beats Framer's aesthetic quality.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Webflow:</strong> Equally capable of stunning designs. More control over every pixel. But the learning curve is steep. What takes 10 minutes in Framer takes 30 minutes in Webflow. Result quality is equal, time investment is not.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Relume:</strong> Doesn't produce final designs. Generates wireframes and structure. Design quality N/A—this is a planning tool, not a design tool.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
        <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Speed to launch: Framer wins
      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Framer:</strong> Fastest workflow in existence. AI generates sections in seconds. Drag-drop editing is intuitive. Components speed up building. For the SaaS site, Framer build took 2 weeks. Traditional Webflow build would've been 4-6 weeks.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Webflow:</strong> Medium speed. Slower than Framer, faster than coding from scratch. The learning curve slows down initial projects. Once you know Webflow, you move fast. But that takes 3-6 months of regular use.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Relume:</strong> Speeds up planning from weeks to minutes. Generating a sitemap takes 30 seconds. What used to require 3-5 planning meetings now takes 1 hour. This is where the time savings happen—preventing rework.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
        <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>CMS power: Webflow dominates
      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Webflow:</strong> Enterprise-grade CMS. Collections, references, filtering, dynamic content. Handles 10,000+ items easily. Perfect for docs, blogs, job boards, directories. The SaaS site migrated at 200 doc articles—Webflow handles 347 today without breaking a sweat.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Framer:</strong> Basic CMS. Collections exist but are limited. Filtering is basic. Reference fields are simplistic. Fine for small blogs (50-100 posts). Not suitable for complex content structures. Hit limits around 200-300 items.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Relume:</strong> No CMS. Planning tool only—wireframes and sitemaps.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
        <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Learning curve: Relume easiest, Webflow hardest
      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Relume:</strong> Easiest. AI generates everything. You review, tweak if needed, export. Zero learning curve if you're okay with AI suggestions.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Framer:</strong> Medium. Easier than Webflow, harder than Squarespace. Drag-drop feels natural. Components speed up learning. Most designers are productive in 1-2 weeks.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Webflow:</strong> Steep. Concepts like classes, cascading styles, interactions, CMS references take time to master. Most designers need 3-6 months to feel truly proficient. Webflow University helps, but it's real work.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
        <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Pricing: Relume free, Framer affordable, Webflow expensive
      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Relume:</strong> Free tier is legit—unlimited sitemaps and wireframes. Paid plans start at $32/month for library access. Most designers never need to pay—free tier handles planning perfectly.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Framer:</strong> $15-25/month for most projects. $15 for Mini (up to 2 pages), $25 for Basic (unlimited pages). Reasonable for freelancers and agencies. No surprise fees.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Webflow:</strong> $18-212/month. Basic plan: $18/month. CMS plans start at $29/month. E-commerce: $42+/month. Enterprise plans hit $212/month quickly. Gets expensive fast. The SaaS site migrated to the $45/month CMS plan—3x Framer's cost.
      </p>

        <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>E-commerce: Webflow wins
      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Webflow:</strong> Full e-commerce platform. Product variants, inventory management, shipping zones, tax calculation, abandoned cart recovery. Powers real online stores doing real revenue. For e-commerce, Webflow is the only choice among these three.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Framer:</strong> Basic e-commerce through Stripe integration. Can sell products but limited. No proper inventory, no variants worth mentioning, no shipping zones. Fine for selling 3-5 products. Not viable for 50+ products.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Relume:</strong> No e-commerce. Planning tool only.

      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Webflow:</strong> Designed for client work. Built-in client billing. Separate editor access. Clients can edit content without breaking design. White-label options for agencies. For agencies serving clients, Webflow is the clear winner.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Framer:</strong> Client handoff is possible but clunky. Share edit link, client has full access (can break things). No built-in client billing. No white-label. Better for products you own than client work.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Most designers skip Relume and go straight to Framer or Webflow. That's a mistake. 90 minutes of planning in Relume prevents 2 weeks of rework. The ROI is infinite—planning saves more time than it costs.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Most designers also think Framer vs. Webflow is an either/or choice. Wrong. Start in Framer for speed and design quality. Migrate to Webflow only when you hit CMS limits. Many sites never need to migrate—Framer handles 90% of use cases perfectly.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The 25-page SaaS site that generated $12,468 in first-month revenue? Started with Relume (free), built in Framer ($15/mo), migrated to Webflow ($45/mo) six months later when CMS limits hit. That's the optimal workflow. Don't skip steps, don't pay for Webflow before you need it.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Use the right tool for each phase. Plan with Relume. Build with Framer. Scale with Webflow if needed. The tools aren't competitors—they're a pipeline.
      </p>
