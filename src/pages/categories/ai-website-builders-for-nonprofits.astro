					<p class="text-sm">
						<strong>Quick reality check:</strong> Nonprofits live on donations. Every barrier in your donation flow loses donors. Every click, every page load, every required field = donor drop-off. Build for frictionless giving: prominent donation button, simple form, recurring option, instant receipt. Optimized donation flow = more mission impact. Poor donation flow = money left on table that could change lives.

					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>What actually matters for nonprofits</h2>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Frictionless donation flow is not optional</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					3 clicks max: donation button → amount → pay. That's it. No account creation. No navigation through multiple pages. No unnecessary fields. Every extra step loses donors. Wix and Squarespace have built-in donation processing with optimized flows. Custom integrations often add friction. Test your donation flow yourself. Count the clicks. If it's more than 3, you're losing money.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Recurring donations = predictable budget</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					One-time donors = unpredictable revenue. Monthly givers = stable budget you can plan around. Offer recurring options prominently. "$10/month feeds a family every month" beats "$10 donation." Specific monthly impact = commitment. Most donation processors support recurring. Wix Payments, Squarespace, Stripe all handle it. Enable recurring. Recurring donors give 4x more over their lifetime than one-time donors.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Stories show impact, statistics count people</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					"We've served 10,000 people" is abstract. "Meet Maria, who found housing after 6 months homeless" is tangible. Donors give to people, not statistics. Combine both: "We've helped 10,000 people like Maria find housing." Stats provide scope. Stories provide humanity. Use both. Stories inspire, statistics validate.

					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Nonprofit discounts matter</h2>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Webflow and Wix: 50% nonprofit discount</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Webflow: 50% off for qualifying nonprofits. That's $106/month saved on their $212 plan. Wix: 50% off with application. Squarespace: occasional nonprofit pricing, ask sales. These discounts aren't always advertised. Contact builders directly, ask for nonprofit pricing. TechSoup also offers discounted software for nonprofits. Never pay full price. That money funds your mission.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Budget options without discounts</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					If discounts aren't available or you need ultra-low-cost: Mixo at $9/month works well. Durable at $15/month includes CRM for donor management. Both are cheaper than discounted major builders. Trade-off: fewer features, less polish. For small nonprofits or volunteer-run orgs, budget options work. As you grow, upgrade to professional builders with nonprofit pricing.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Built-in CRM for donor management</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Durable includes built-in CRM. Track donors, manage donations, send follow-ups. For nonprofits without dedicated donor software, this is huge value. Otherwise you're paying for website builder + separate donor CRM. All-in-one saves money and reduces complexity. Wix has Wix CRM. Squarespace integrates with donor platforms. Consider donor management when choosing.
