				"@type": "Answer",

However, they have limitations: vendor lock-in (most don't allow code export), design constraints, and ongoing costs. For serious businesses needing custom features, traditional development may still be better."

				<p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Look, here's the unpolished truth:</p>

				<div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700">
					<p>
						<strong>September 2024:</strong> Sarah's coffee shop in Austin needed a site. I tried Wix AI. Generated in 2 minutes. Looked like 500 other coffee shops. She said "this looks like a template, not my business." Lost the $2,500 gig.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>October 2024:</strong> Marcus's SaaS startup needed a landing page. Used Framer. Beautiful design. But when he asked for the code to deploy to his own server—nope. Framer locks you in. He had to pay $25/month forever or rebuild. He was pissed.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>November 2024:</strong> Started testing everything. Durable AI generated sites in 30 seconds but looked like 2015. 10Web's "export" just backed up to WordPress. Hostinger's AI disappeared after 48 hours. Every tool had a hidden catch.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>December 2024:</strong> Looked for honest reviews. Every site just repeated marketing claims. "Best AI builder!" "Free forever!" "No coding needed!" All bullshit. Nobody mentioned the lock-in, the broken exports, the expiring free plans.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="mt-8 p-6 bg-white border-[3px] border-[#F5521A]/30">
					<p class="text-sm text-gray-600 italic">
						<strong>So I built this site.</strong> Not as an affiliate farm (though yes, I use affiliate links). Not to sell you anything. Because I was frustrated that nobody was telling the truth about AI website builders. The lock-in is real. The broken exports are real. The "free" plans that expire are real.
					</p>
					<p class="text-sm text-gray-600 italic mt-3">
						<strong>You should know this before you spend $20/month on something you can't leave.</strong>
