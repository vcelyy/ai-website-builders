## Why I Chose Framer (After 5 Days of Paralysis)

I spent 5 days researching:
- Framer vs Wix vs Webflow vs Squarespace vs Dora
- Reading comparison posts
- Watching YouTube reviews
- Making spreadsheets of features

Result: Zero sites built.

Then I picked Framer randomly and built something in 47 minutes.

**Lesson:** First review > perfect plan.

## What Makes Framer ADHD-Friendly

### 1. Instant Visual Feedback
You type: "Hero section with blue button"
Framer shows: Exactly that in real-time

ADHD brains need instant dopamine hits. Framer provides them continuously.

### 2. No "Blank Page" Paralysis
Starting templates:
- Portfolio
- Product landing
- Blog
- Startup

All are ACTUAL good designs, not placeholder trash. Pick one, tweak, launch.

### 3. Natural Language Styling
Want bigger text? Type "Make text bigger."
Want different color? "Change to navy blue."

No hunting through 50 CSS files. Just say what you want.

### 4. Copy-Paste Other Sites
See a layout you like?
- Paste URL into Framer
- It recreates the layout
- Tweak to your needs

Brilliant for ADHD brains that think visually.

### 5. Built-in Animations
Scroll effects, hover states, page transitions - all pre-built.
No coding required. Just toggle on/off.

## What I Built in 47 Minutes

**My first site:**
1. Picked "Startup" template (2 min)
2. Changed colors to my brand (5 min)
3. Swapped placeholder text (10 min)
4. Added my logo (3 min)
5. Connected custom domain (7 min)
6. Published (2 min)
7. Fix responsive issues on mobile (18 min)

**Total:** 47 minutes from zero to live.

## The Limitations (Be Aware)

### 1. Not for Complex Apps
If you need:
- User authentication
- Database operations
- Complex business logic

Framer isn't for you. Use Webflow or code it.

### 2. Learning Curve for Advanced Features
Variables, components, CMS - there's depth here.
But you don't NEED it for simple sites.

### 3. Export Isn't Perfect
You can export to React code, but it's not production-clean.
Better to host on Framer for simple sites.

## Pricing Reality

**Free tier:**
- 2 sites
- Framer branding
- Limited CMS

**Pro ($15/month):**
- Unlimited sites
- Custom domain
- CMS included
- Remove branding

**Worth it?** Yes. $15/month for instant sites is a steal.

## Comparison: Framer vs Others

### Framer vs Webflow
- **Framer:** Faster to learn, simpler sites
- **Webflow:** More powerful, steeper learning curve

For ADHD entrepreneurs: Start with Framer.

### Framer vs Wix
- **Framer:** Modern designs, better UX
- **Wix:** More templates, but feels dated

### Framer vs Squarespace

- **Squarespace:** More structured, less flexibility
