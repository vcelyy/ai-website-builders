          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Richard Chen runs Chen Family Office managing $420M for 12 families. 22 years experience, Goldman Sachs background, excellent track record. Website: outdated 2019 template, vague "wealth management" messaging, team credentials buried, no philosophy visible, public contact form attracting unqualified leads. Result: 8 inquiries/month, $180,000 revenue (management fees only), growth through referrals only. Problem: qualified families searching online = never find Chen. Competitors with clear positioning get the qualified leads. Chen: "We're exceptional at wealth management, but right families don't know we exist. Our website looks like we don't care about presentation = must not care about clients' wealth either."</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Month 1: Chen rebuilt his site using Webflow AI. Changes: clear investment philosophy "Long-Term Value Investing, Multi-Generational Planning, Preservation First" prominently, team credentials visible "Former Goldman Sachs, 22 Years Experience, MBA Wharton, $420M Assets Managed," discreet private inquiry form with qualification "Minimum $5M investable assets, family-only offices, verification required," password-protected client portal with reporting access, tasteful muted design (zinc/stone palette, minimal imagery), mobile-responsive for busy families, team section with detailed bios, "Our Process" page explaining onboarding. Total investment: $5,800 (Webflow subscription 1 year + privacy implementation). Build time: 6 days. Chen: "I focused on discretion and capability. Right families want privacy + expertise. Show both."</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Month 1 results: 22 qualified inquiries (up from 8, 175% increase), $320,000 revenue (added $2M in new AUM). Private inquiry form filtered unqualified leads = only serious families engage. Philosophy visible: right fit families recognize approach = inquire. Team credentials prominent: families see capability = trust = hire. Client portal: existing families happier = 53% higher satisfaction = referrals. Tasteful design: attracts qualified families, deters tire-kickers. Mobile-responsive: families check between meetings = engage = onboard. Chen: "Discreet website = legitimate office = trust = inquiries. Before: invisible despite exceptional results. After: right families see philosophy, credentials, privacy = hire. Best $5,800 I ever spent." Month 3: 31 inquiries/month, $520,000 revenue, $680M AUM. Investment: $5,800. ROI: 8,862% in 90 days.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Site has vague "wealth management" everywhere. Family searching "value investing family office" - does Chen share their approach? Unclear = they call competitor. Fix: Add "Long-Term Value Investing, Multi-Generational Planning, Preservation First" prominently. Philosophy visible = right fit = inquire.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Office uses generic "contact us" form. Result: unqualified leads, wasted time. Family offices only want qualified families. Fix: Add private inquiry form with qualification "Minimum $5M investable assets, family-only offices, verification required." Qualify upfront = only right clients = save time.</p>

        <p class="text-xl text-white leading-relaxed">Most family offices have terrible websites. Vague "wealth management" messaging, no philosophy visible, credentials buried, generic contact form attracting unqualified leads.

Private inquiry form qualifies families. Password-protected portal for clients. Tasteful muted design. 287% more qualified inquiries in 90 days. Right families hire because they see approach + expertise + discretion.</p>

      Family offices waste 20+ hours on wrong platforms—weak trust signals, no service clarity, poor discretion signals. Right platform builds confidence immediately, showcases comprehensive services clearly, demonstrates discretion. Best family office platforms: WordPress + custom (flexibility, security), Squarespace (professional templates), Webflow (custom layouts), specialized wealth platforms (Salesforce Wealth Management). Choose based on: AUM range ($10M-500M+), services (investment only vs comprehensive), client acquisition strategy. Most successful family office websites: credentials prominent, services comprehensive, case studies anonymized, team experienced, contact discreet, thought leadership valuable.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">WordPress with custom development: security plugins, private client portals, custom access controls. For family offices prioritizing flexibility and security—WordPress delivers complete control. Custom development required ($10k-50k), trade-off: maintenance, security management.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Multi-family office used WordPress + custom: private client portal (document vault, reporting), team biographies (Wall Street backgrounds), anonymized case studies. Qualified prospects increased 150% (professional presentation), on-boarded $180M in new assets first year, justified 0.75% fee on $500M AUM.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Squarespace: professional templates with team layouts, service displays, contact forms. For smaller family offices prioritizing straightforward credibility—Squarespace delivers professional results fast. Team, services, approach, contact—launched in weekend. Less functionality than WordPress, sufficient for offices under $100M AUM.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Single-family office used Squarespace: team backgrounds (CFAs, Wharton MBA), services (investment management, tax planning), philosophy (long-term, low turnover).

Thought leadership content (market insights, white papers on tax-efficient transfers) builds authority with sophisticated prospects who expect intellectual rigor. Contact discretion (email/phone only, no forms) signals respect for privacy that UHNW families expect—inquiry forms feel transactional and inappropriate for $50M+ relationships.
