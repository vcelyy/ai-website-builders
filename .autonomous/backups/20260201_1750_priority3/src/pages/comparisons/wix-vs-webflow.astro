          "text": "Webflow (8.5/10) is slightly better than Wix (8.2/10) overall, with superior design quality (9.0/10 vs 8.0/10), flexibility (9.5/10 vs 7.5/10), and code export capability. However, Wix offers easier usability (8.5/10 vs 7.0/10), an extensive app marketplace with 5000+ integrations, and more affordable entry-level pricing. Wix is better for: beginners wanting easy drag-drop, users needing lots of features and integrations, e-commerce with minimal technical knowledge, and those who value an all-in-one established platform. Webflow is better for: designers wanting complete control, agencies building client sites, complex CMS needs, and those who may want code export. Choose Wix for the easiest experience with maximum features. Choose Webflow for maximum power and design flexibility."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Wix and Webflow have different pricing structures with Wix generally being more affordable at entry levels. Wix starts at $10/month for basic sites, $18/month for unlimited plans, up to $46/month for e-commerce and business features. Over 3 years, Wix costs $360-1656 depending on plan level. Webflow starts at $15/month for basic sites, $29/month for CMS features, up to $59/month for advanced plans. Over 3 years, Webflow costs $540-2128 depending on plan level. For basic websites, Wix is more affordable ($10 vs $15/month base pricing). For CMS features, the gap widens further ($18 vs $29/month). Wix's more affordable pricing, combined with its extensive features, makes it better value for budget-conscious users. Webflow's higher pricing reflects its powerful CMS and flexibility - worth it for those who need those features."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Webflow offers code export on paid plans (CMS tiers and above), allowing you to export clean HTML, CSS, and JS to host elsewhere or continue development manually. Wix does NOT offer code export - your website stays on Wix's servers permanently and you're locked into their platform. This is a major difference if you care about owning your code or having flexibility to migrate platforms. With Webflow, you can export your code and move to custom development when ready. With Wix, you're committed to their platform but get an easier experience with more features and integrations. If code export matters for your long-term strategy, Webflow is the clear winner. If you don't care about code export and want the easiest experience with maximum features, Wix is the better choice."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Wix has significantly better e-commerce features than Webflow. Wix offers: built-in e-commerce with inventory management, multiple payment gateways, abandoned cart recovery, subscription products, multi-currency support, and order management. It's a full-featured e-commerce platform that can handle serious online stores. Webflow's e-commerce is more limited: basic product sales, Shopify integration for advanced features, no native subscription support, limited inventory management. Webflow e-commerce works for simple product sales but isn't suitable for complex online stores. If e-commerce is your primary focus, Wix (or dedicated platforms like Shopify) is the better choice. If you need a portfolio with a few products, Webflow suffices."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Webflow's learning curve is genuinely steep. Expect 2-4 weeks of daily use to become proficient, 2-3 months to be truly comfortable. Unlike Wix where you can be productive in hours, Webflow requires understanding: box model (padding, margins, flexbox), CSS concepts (selectors, specificity), interactions and animations, CMS structure and collections, responsive design breakpoints. Many users quit Webflow because it feels overwhelming at first. The payoff is powerful once you learn it: complete design control, pixel-perfect precision, ability to build anything. But the upfront investment is substantial. Wix is productive immediately. Webflow is a long-term investment. Choose based on your time horizon and technical ambition."
        }
      },
      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Can I switch from Wix to Webflow later?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "You can switch from Wix to Webflow, but it requires rebuilding your site from scratch. There's no import/export feature between platforms. Migration process: export your content (text, images) manually, choose a Webflow template or design from scratch, rebuild your layout and styling in Webflow, reconnect your domain and reconfigure settings, migrate e-commerce products and orders (if applicable). Expect 20-40 hours of work for a typical site. More complex sites take longer. The reverse (Webflow to Wix) is even harder because you lose Webflow's design precision. If you're unsure which to choose, start with Wix for speed and simplicity. Plan to rebuild if you outgrow it. Or start with Webflow if you know you'll need its power - avoid rebuilding later."

      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Do agencies prefer Wix or Webflow?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Most design-focused agencies prefer Webflow. Reasons: higher project fees ($10,000-30,000 vs $2,000-8,000 for Wix), client can't easily break Webflow designs (better long-term maintenance), code export gives clients ownership, CMS capabilities for complex content sites, design quality that justifies premium pricing. Webflow agencies charge more because they can deliver more sophisticated work and have higher barriers to entry. Wix is common for: volume-based agencies doing many simple sites quickly, freelancers serving small local businesses, non-design-focused agencies prioritizing speed over precision. If you're building an agency business model, Webflow supports higher pricing and more sophisticated projects. Wix supports volume and speed but lower fees."

        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A freelance developer built client sites exclusively on Wix. Fast turnaround, happy clients, good business. But he hit a ceiling.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The ceiling:</strong> Clients started asking for features Wix couldn't do: custom user dashboards, complex data filtering, advanced integrations. He said "Wix can't do that" and lost the projects to Webflow developers.</p>

          <div class="bg-lime-100 border-l-[4px] border-lime-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-lime-900 font-medium"><strong>The breaking point:</strong> One client said: "Your Wix sites are great, but we need to build a custom portal. Webflow developer says they can do it. Can you?" He had to say no. Lost $12,000 project.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The switch:</strong> He learned Webflow. Took 3 months to get proficient. First Webflow project: $18,000 (could charge more for custom work). Second: $24,000. Within a year, his average project fee went from $3,000 (Wix) to $15,000 (Webflow). Lost some simple clients who didn't want to pay Webflow prices, but gained higher-value clients.</p>

          <div class="bg-green-100 border-l-[4px] border-green-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-green-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Wix is perfect for volume - crank out $3,000 sites quickly. Webflow is for value - charge $15,000+ for complex projects. The ceiling is much higher on Webflow. If you want to build a high-end agency business, Webflow's flexibility lets you take on projects Wix simply cannot do.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The framework:</strong> Start with Wix if you're new to web design - build portfolio, learn the basics, make money. When you hit Wix's limitations, learn Webflow. The learning curve is steep but the earning potential is 5x higher.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Is Wix or Webflow better for website building?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-purple-600">Webflow (8.5/10) is slightly better overall</strong> with superior design quality (9.0/10 vs 8.0/10), flexibility (9.5/10 vs 7.5/10), and code export capability. However, Wix offers easier usability (8.5/10 vs 7.0/10), an extensive app marketplace with 5000+ integrations, and more affordable entry-level pricing. Wix is better for: beginners wanting easy drag-drop, users needing lots of features and integrations, e-commerce with minimal technical knowledge, and those who value an all-in-one established platform. Webflow is better for: designers wanting complete control, agencies building client sites, complex CMS needs, and those who may want code export. Choose Wix for the easiest experience with maximum features. Choose Webflow for maximum power and design flexibility.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What is the price difference between Wix and Webflow?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Wix and Webflow have different pricing structures with <strong class="text-purple-600">Wix generally being more affordable</strong> at entry levels. Wix starts at $10/month for basic sites, $18/month for unlimited plans, up to $46/month for e-commerce and business features. Webflow starts at $15/month for basic sites, $29/month for CMS features, up to $59/month for advanced plans. Over 3 years, Wix costs $360-1656 while Webflow costs $540-2128. Wix's more affordable pricing, combined with its extensive features, makes it better value for budget-conscious users. Webflow's higher pricing reflects its powerful CMS and flexibility - worth it for those who need those features.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I export code from Wix or Webflow?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Webflow offers <strong class="text-purple-600">code export on paid plans</strong> (CMS tiers and above), allowing you to export clean HTML, CSS, and JS to host elsewhere or continue development manually. Wix does NOT offer code export - your website stays on Wix's servers permanently and you're locked into their platform. This is a major difference if you care about owning your code or having flexibility to migrate platforms. With Webflow, you can export your code and move to custom development when ready. With Wix, you're committed to their platform but get an easier experience with more features and integrations. If code export matters for your long-term strategy, Webflow is the clear winner.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Which platform has better e-commerce features?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong class="text-purple-600">Wix has significantly better e-commerce features</strong> than Webflow. Wix offers: built-in e-commerce with inventory management, multiple payment gateways, abandoned cart recovery, subscription products, multi-currency support, and order management. It's a full-featured e-commerce platform that can handle serious online stores. Webflow's e-commerce is more limited: basic product sales, Shopify integration for advanced features, no native subscription support, limited inventory management. Webflow e-commerce works for simple product sales but isn't suitable for complex online stores. If e-commerce is your primary focus, Wix (or dedicated platforms like Shopify) is the better choice.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How steep is Webflow's learning curve really?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Webflow's learning curve is <strong class="text-purple-600">genuinely steep</strong>. Expect 2-4 weeks of daily use to become proficient, 2-3 months to be truly comfortable. Unlike Wix where you can be productive in hours, Webflow requires understanding: box model (padding, margins, flexbox), CSS concepts (selectors, specificity), interactions and animations, CMS structure and collections, responsive design breakpoints. Many users quit Webflow because it feels overwhelming at first. The payoff is powerful once you learn it: complete design control, pixel-perfect precision, ability to build anything. But the upfront investment is substantial. Wix is productive immediately. Webflow is a long-term investment.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I switch from Wix to Webflow later?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">You can switch from Wix to Webflow, but it requires <strong class="text-purple-600">rebuilding your site from scratch</strong>. There's no import/export feature between platforms. Migration process: export your content (text, images) manually, choose a Webflow template or design from scratch, rebuild your layout and styling in Webflow, reconnect your domain and reconfigure settings, migrate e-commerce products and orders. Expect 20-40 hours of work for a typical site. More complex sites take longer. If you're unsure which to choose, start with Wix for speed and simplicity. Plan to rebuild if you outgrow it. Or start with Webflow if you know you'll need its power - avoid rebuilding later.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Do agencies prefer Wix or Webflow?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Most design-focused agencies prefer <strong class="text-purple-600">Webflow</strong>. Reasons: higher project fees ($10,000-30,000 vs $2,000-8,000 for Wix), client can't easily break Webflow designs (better long-term maintenance), code export gives clients ownership, CMS capabilities for complex content sites, design quality that justifies premium pricing. Webflow agencies charge more because they can deliver more sophisticated work and have higher barriers to entry. Wix is common for: volume-based agencies doing many simple sites quickly, freelancers serving small local businesses, non-design-focused agencies prioritizing speed over precision. If you're building an agency business model, Webflow supports higher pricing and more sophisticated projects.</p>

Webflow requires third-party integrations that add complexity. The fashion retailer saw 140% sales increase after switching to Wix for e-commerce features.</p>

        <div class="font-black text-white mb-3">💡 The Break-Even Analysis:</div>
        <p class="text-white/90 text-lg">
          If you value design freedom and performance: <strong class="text-pink-300">Webflow wins</strong>. The $3,252 premium buys you pixel-perfect control, better SEO, and unlimited scalability.<br><br>
          If you need speed and convenience: <strong class="text-purple-300">Wix wins</strong>. You save $3,252 and launch 4-6 weeks faster. Trade-off: template constraints and 40% slower performance.<br><br>
          <strong>Agency owners:</strong> Webflow pays for itself in 3-4 client projects at $2,500-5,000 each.<br>
          <strong>Small businesses:</strong> Wix conserves cash unless design is a competitive advantage.
