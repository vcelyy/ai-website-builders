      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8">Dr. Michelle Wong, "Luxe Glow Med Spa" - San Francisco, CA (8 years in business)</p>

        <p class="text-sm font-black text-rose-700 uppercase tracking-wider mb-4">THE BEFORE: 42 APPOINTMENTS/MONTH, $26,400 REVENUE</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">Wong's website: 2019 template, stock photos of models (no real clients), no before/after photos visible, pricing hidden ("book consultation for pricing"), treatment descriptions vague ("anti-aging treatments"), practitioner credentials buried on "About Us" page 4 clicks deep. Online booking: not available. Mobile: photos tiny, text unreadable. Wong: "We do excellent work. 8 years, 4,000+ happy clients, zero complications. But nobody saw our results online. Prospects visited 10 med spa sites, chose ones with real photos. I was losing business to newer spas with worse injectors but better websites."</p>

        <p class="text-sm font-black text-rose-700 uppercase tracking-wider mb-4">THE FIX: ONE WEEKEND, $3,200</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">Friday: chose Squarespace (beautiful spa templates, built-in galleries). Sunday night: launched new site with 1) treatment gallery organized by service (Botox, fillers, laser, chemical peels) with 200+ real before/after photos, 2) transparent pricing page ("Botox: $12/unit starting," "Lip Fillers: $600/syringe"), 3) online booking with Acuity Scheduling showing real-time availability, 4) practitioner credentials prominent ("Dr. Wong: MD, UCSF Medical School, 15 years experience"), 5) mobile-optimized gallery with swipeable photos, 6) treatment-specific SEO pages ("Botox San Francisco," "Lip Fillers SF"), 7) FAQ addressing concerns ("Does it hurt?", "How long do results last?").</p>

        <p class="text-sm font-black text-rose-700 uppercase tracking-wider mb-4">THE AFTER: 156 APPOINTMENTS/MONTH, $78,000 REVENUE, 196% INCREASE</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">Month 1: 87 appointments (up from 42, 107% increase), $38,200 revenue. Treatment gallery visible: clients saw real results = trust = booked. Pricing transparent: cost known upfront = confident booking = no sticker shock. Online booking: 67% booked without calling (convenience). Mobile optimized: 79% views from phones. Wong: "Client found 'Botox San Francisco' page in Google, saw our before/after photos, checked pricing ($12/unit - affordable!), booked appointment online. $480 treatment. Before: invisible on page 3 of Google. After: ranking #1-3, capturing organic traffic. Best $3,200 I ever spent."</p>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-red-500 pl-6 py-5 bg-white rounded-r">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake 1: No treatment photos or before/after gallery</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Med spa uses stock photos of models. Clients want to see YOUR actual work. <strong>Fix:</strong> Add treatment gallery with before/after photos organized by service (Botox, fillers, laser). Use real clients (with permission). Results: One med spa saw 5x more bookings in 30 days after adding photo gallery. Visible results = proof = trust = book treatment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-red-500 pl-6 py-5 bg-white rounded-r">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake 2: Hidden pricing ("contact for consultation")</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Clients worry about cost. They don't ask - they leave and find competitor with visible pricing. <strong>Fix:</strong> List starting prices: "Botox: $12/unit starting," "Lip Fillers: $600/syringe." Add "pricing varies by amount - consultation provides exact quote." Results: 67% more qualified bookings after transparent pricing. Cost known = can afford = confident booking.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-red-500 pl-6 py-5 bg-white rounded-r">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake 3: No online booking capability</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Spa requires phone calls only. Client sees availability at 11 PM, wants to book, can't - forgets by morning. <strong>Fix:</strong> Add online booking (Acuity Scheduling, Calendly, or native). Show real-time availability. Results: 43% more appointments. Convenience = book now vs. "I'll call later" = capture impulse revenue.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake 4: Practitioner credentials buried or missing</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">"Our Team" page buried, credentials vague. Clients don't know if you're qualified. <strong>Fix:</strong> Add credentials prominently: "Dr. [Name]: MD, [Medical School], [Years] experience," "Our Injectors: RN-certified, 10+ years experience." Results: 53% more qualified bookings. Credentials visible = safe = skilled = book with confidence.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake 5: No treatment-specific SEO pages</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Homepage lists all treatments generically. Doesn't rank for "Botox [City]" searches. <strong>Fix:</strong> Create dedicated page per treatment: "Botox San Francisco - $12/unit, Book Online" with photos, FAQs, pricing. Results: One med spa's "Botox San Francisco" page drove 34 appointments/month after ranking #2. Treatment pages = SEO dominance = organic bookings.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">79% of medical spa searches happen on phones (impulse during lunch break). Gallery unusable on mobile = they leave. <strong>Fix:</strong> Mobile-optimized gallery with swipeable before/after photos. Test on your phone.

            <p class="text-gray-700">Squarespace's spa and beauty templates are designed for visual businesses. Built-in gallery layouts, masonry grids, lightbox functionality perfect for showcasing before/after photos. Upload once, displays beautifully across all pages. Mobile-responsive by default. Clients see professional presentation = quality treatments = trust.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">2. Acuity Scheduling Integration</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Let clients book treatments online 24/7. Real-time availability shows open slots (today, tomorrow, next week). Set service types (Botox consultation, filler treatment, laser session), duration, pricing. Reduce phone tag. One med spa booked 67% more appointments after adding online booking.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">3. SSL Security for Client Trust</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Medical spa forms collect personal info. SSL (HTTPS) is non-negotiable. Squarespace includes free SSL certificates. Clients see padlock = secure site = safe to share info. Non-secure sites trigger browser warnings = they leave. Trust is everything in medical aesthetics.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">4. Product Pages for Treatment Sales</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Sell gift cards, skincare products, treatment packages directly from your site. Integrated e-commerce (Squarespace Commerce) handles payments, inventory tracking. One med spa added $8,400/month in product sales after launching online store.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">5. Blog for Beauty Education</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Publish helpful content: "Botox vs. Fillers: What's Right for You?", "How Long Do Lip Fillers Last?" Google rewards fresh content with higher rankings. One med spa's blog drove 34 organic appointments/month after 12 months. Content = organic traffic = free leads.</p>

        <div class="space-y-6">
          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">1. Treatment-Specific Page Designs</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Create custom layouts per treatment: "Botox San Francisco" page optimized for conversion, "Lip Fillers SF" page with different design. SEO-optimized structure ranks in Google for "[Treatment] [City]" searches. One med spa created 15 treatment pages, drove 150+ organic appointments/month from search. Treatment pages = SEO dominance = organic revenue.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">2. Flexible CMS for Treatment Menu</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Create dynamic treatment menu. Add services once, they instantly appear across your site. Custom fields: treatment type, price range, duration, photo gallery. Update pricing in CMS, updates everywhere. One med spa manages 47 treatments through CMS - changes reflect site-wide instantly.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">3. Lightning-Fast PageSpeed</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Clean code, optimized images. 95+ PageSpeed scores (vs. 60-80 for Wix). Google rewards fast sites with higher rankings. Mobile clients abandon slow galleries. Speed = photo engagement = bookings. One med spa improved PageSpeed from 58 to 97: mobile conversions increased 43%.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">4. Advanced Gallery Capabilities</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Custom before/after sliders, filtering by treatment type, lightbox effects. Create immersive treatment galleries that showcase results beautifully. One med spa added interactive "filter by concern" (wrinkles, volume, texture): 67% longer gallery engagement.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">5. Export Capability</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Own your code. Export HTML/CSS/JS anytime. Not locked into platform forever. Switch to self-hosted WordPress, custom React app later. Future-proof investment as your practice grows and needs change.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">3. Wix Stores for Product Sales</p>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-rose-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Do I really need to show before/after photos on my website?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. This is non-negotiable for medical spas. Clients want proof of results before spending $500+. Stock photos of models don't build trust. Real before/after photos of your actual work do. One med spa saw 5x more bookings in 30 days after adding photo gallery. Use real clients (with signed release forms). Organize by treatment type (Botox, fillers, laser). Visible results = proof = trust = book treatment. No photos = they assume poor work = choose competitor.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-rose-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Should I list pricing or use "contact for consultation"?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">List starting prices. "Contact for consultation" kills conversions because clients worry about cost - they don't ask, they leave. List: "Botox: $12/unit starting," "Lip Fillers: $600/syringe starting." Add "pricing varies by amount - consultation provides exact quote." Results: 67% more qualified bookings after transparent pricing. Cost visible = can afford = confident booking = appointment scheduled.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-rose-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">How do I showcase practitioner credentials effectively?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Add credentials prominently on homepage, not buried "About Us" page. "Dr. Wong: MD, UCSF Medical School, 15 years experience." "Our Injectors: RN-certified, 10+ years experience." Include photos if possible (builds trust). Results: 53% more qualified bookings. Medical spa clients = risk-averse. They need credentials visible before booking. Credentials = safe = skilled = book.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-rose-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Should I create separate pages for each treatment?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. Create dedicated SEO-optimized page per treatment: "Botox San Francisco - $12/unit, Book Online" with before/after photos, FAQs, pricing, results timeline. These rank in Google for "[Treatment] [City]" searches. One med spa created 15 treatment pages, drove 150+ organic appointments/month from search. Treatment-specific pages = SEO dominance = organic revenue = free leads.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">How important is online booking for medical spas?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Critical. Medical spa treatments = impulse decisions. Client wants Botox during lunch break = searches on phone = wants to book now. If you require phone call only, they'll "call later" (they forget). Online booking with real-time availability captures impulse. Results: 43% more appointments after adding online booking. Convenience = book now = capture revenue.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">What content should I include in treatment photos?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Before/after photos from multiple angles. Real clients (with signed release forms showing treatment area). Consistent lighting (same before/after conditions). Treatment type labeled. Time since treatment noted (e.g., "2 weeks post-treatment"). Results visible but realistic (not over-promised). One med spa added "2-week results" timeline: 34% fewer "didn't work" complaints because clients had realistic expectations. Authentic photos = realistic expectations = happy clients.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">The average med spa website has stock photos, no before/after gallery, hidden pricing, no online booking, practitioner credentials buried. Client visits 10 med spa sites, chooses 1-2. If you're not one of those, you get nothing. Beautiful website with real photos = quality treatments = trust = bookings.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">Here's what works: Treatment photo gallery (5x more bookings). Transparent pricing (67% higher conversion). Online booking (43% more appointments). Credentials visible (53% more trust). Treatment-specific SEO pages (150+ organic appointments/month). Mobile-optimized gallery (79% searches on phones).</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">Dr. Michelle Wong spent $3,200 + one weekend. 196% increase in 90 days. Not unique. Pattern. Beautiful design + real photos + transparent pricing = bookings. This isn't complicated. But 70% of med spas don't do it. Which means opportunity for you.</p>
