Generic template from 2019, no conditions treated listed, buried "contact us" form, zero patient testimonials, no insurance info visible. "Most of my patients come from doctor referrals," she told me. Meanwhile patients with back pain were searching online, finding competitors with clear condition pages, patient stories, easy booking - and booking appointments there. Sarah was invisible to the 47+ patients searching "physical therapist Austin back pain" daily. She was leaving $45,000+ monthly on the table.</p>

Added "Book Online in 60 Seconds" above fold. Added "We Accept: Blue Cross, Aetna, Cigna, Medicare" with logos. Added "Dr. Sarah Chen, DPT, OCS, 15 Years Experience" prominently.

          <p class="text-gray-300">Bullshit. Your referral patients ALSO search online to find you. If you're invisible or generic, they question the referral. Patients search "physical therapist near me [condition]" - if you don't appear clearly treating that condition, they book elsewhere. Referrals = verify online. Online presence = referrals convert.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-300">Patients search by condition: "physical therapist for back pain," "sports injury rehab," "post-surgery PT."

          <p class="text-gray-300">Wrong. Testimonials with specific conditions and recovery outcomes prove you're effective. "Dr. Chen fixed my sciatica in 8 weeks" = hope = this works for me = book appointment. No testimonials = no proof = no trust = no booking.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">Wix excels for quick setup with healthcare templates and built-in Wix Bookings for appointment scheduling. Template variety is massive - you'll find PT-specific designs. Easy to use - launch in hours. Mobile app makes updates from clinic convenient. However, performance issues are real - many Wix sites score 60-75 PageSpeed. Template lock-in means switching later = rebuild. Monthly pricing adds up. Ad-heavy editor can be confusing. If performance matters for healthcare SEO, Wix may hurt long-term rankings.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-8">FAQ: Physical Therapy Websites</h2>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Do physical therapists really need a website?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. 73% of patients search online for physical therapists, even those with doctor referrals. No website = invisible to patients verifying referrals online. Your competitors with clear condition pages get the appointments. You get nothing. Pain urgency = search now = book now.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Should I list all conditions treated?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, prominently above fold. Patients search by condition: "physical therapist for back pain," "sports injury rehab." Visible conditions = you treat my pain = book appointment. Hidden conditions = you don't specialize = I call someone who does.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Are patient testimonials important for PTs?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Critical. Condition-specific testimonials with recovery outcomes prove effectiveness. "Dr. Chen fixed my sciatica in 8 weeks, back to running" = hope = this works = book appointment. 67% higher conversion with testimonials vs without.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Should I show insurance information?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, prominently above fold with logos if possible. "We Accept: Blue Cross, Aetna, Cigna, Medicare" visible instantly = 53% more qualified calls. Patients need to know they can afford care before booking. Hidden insurance = fewer bookings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">How important is online booking for PTs?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Essential. 73% of searches happen on phones from patients in pain. Mobile-optimized booking = they schedule immediately. Phone-only booking = they call competitor with online booking. Pain urgency = convenience wins.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-xl mb-3">Should I create recovery education content?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes if you want organic search traffic. Austin PT published recovery guides, exercise tips, got 287 patients from search in 12 months vs 47 without. Education content = expertise visible = trust = organic traffic = appointments. Content compounds over time.</p>

    <div class="container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 max-w-4xl">
      <h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-black text-white mb-6">The Brutal Truth</h2>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">Most physical therapy websites are generic, outdated, invisible. "Contact us for appointment" forms that nobody fills out. No conditions treated listed. No patient testimonials. No insurance info. No credentials visible. No mobile booking. Meanwhile PTs with solid sites get all the pain-driven searches, all the appointments, all the revenue.</p>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">Here's what actually works: Conditions treated visible above fold (5x more bookings). Patient testimonials with specific conditions (67% higher conversion). Recovery education content (6x more organic patients). Mobile-optimized booking (73% of searches). Insurance acceptance prominent (53% more qualified calls). Credentials visible (47% more first-time patients).</p>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">Stop making excuses. "Doctor referrals are enough" = invisible to online searches. "I don't need to list conditions" = patients assume you don't treat their pain. "Testimonials are unprofessional" = no proof = no trust. "Mobile booking isn't necessary" = 73% of searches can't book easily. "Insurance is secondary" = patients can't tell if they can afford care.</p>

      <div class="bg-teal-500/20 border-[3px] border-teal-500 p-8 my-10">
        <p class="text-teal-300 font-black text-2xl mb-4">Winner: Squarespace AI</p>
        <p class="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed">For 90% of physical therapists, Squarespace is the clear winner. Healthcare templates communicate professionalism and trust instantly. Condition-treatment pages are clear and patient-friendly. Patient booking integration works seamlessly. Mobile responsiveness is excellent when patients search in pain. One-day launch. Acceptable performance (80-90 PageSpeed). Start here. Upgrade to Webflow only if you need extensive condition libraries or PageSpeed 95+. Don't overcomplicate it.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">List your conditions. Show patient testimonials. Make booking easy. Show insurance prominently. Display credentials. Educate patients. Get appointments. Stop leaving $45,000+ monthly on the table. Patients are searching in pain right now. Make yourself findable.</p>
