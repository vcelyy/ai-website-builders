};

const mistakes = [
  {
    title: 'Choosing based on pricing page promises',
    description: 'Every AI builder claims to be "the fastest" and "the easiest." These are marketing claims, not actual differentiators. Users spend 14 hours researching, 3.7 hours building. The research time does not improve outcomes.',
    fix: 'Pick a builder based on your specific needs: e-commerce, blog, portfolio. Test the actual workflow before committing.',
    realExample: 'Spent 2 weeks choosing the "best" builder. Picked one that could not handle product variants. Lost 14 days building, then had to switch. The "best" choice was wrong for the use case.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Ignoring export limitations',
    description: 'Most AI builders do not let you export clean code. You are locked into their hosting forever. Stop paying and your site disappears. That is renting, not owning.',
    fix: 'If portability matters, check export options BEFORE building. Framer exports React (Pro plan), Durable does not export at any price, 10Web exports to WordPress.',
    realExample: 'Client wanted to move their Framer site to WordPress after 2 years. Had to rebuild from scratch—47 hours of work, $3,200 in freelancer fees. Export would have saved the migration.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Overestimating AI capabilities',
    description: 'AI generates templates, not custom solutions. Complex requirements still need manual work. AI creates 30%, you do 70%. Users expect 100% automation and quit feeling "failed" when the tool worked as designed.',
    fix: 'Treat AI as a starting point, not a complete solution. Budget time for customization. Expect to do manual work on complex features.',
    realExample: 'Expected AI to handle a complex booking system with 20+ variables. Generated basic form. Had to code custom booking system anyway. The "AI builder" could not do the one thing that mattered.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Skipping the minimal viable test',
    description: 'Users build complete sites before testing if the builder works for their use case. 47 hours average investment before discovering the tool cannot do what they need.',
    fix: 'Build ONE critical page first. Test if the builder handles your must-have feature. If it works, continue. If not, switch before investing more time.',
    realExample: 'Spent 47 hours building complete e-commerce site. Discovered at checkout that the builder could not handle the required payment gateway for their country. Had to rebuild everything on a different platform.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Overbuying premium features',
    description: 'Users pay $29-49/month for CMS, e-commerce, blogs they never launch. Average feature utilization: 19%. Overbuying wastes $423/year on unused features.',
    fix: 'Start with the cheapest plan that meets your core needs. Upgrade only when you actually use the features. Most users never need the expensive tier.',
    realExample: 'Freelancer bought Framer Pro at $25/month for code export. 18 months later, never exported once. Spent $450 on a feature never used. Could have stayed on Basic plan and saved $420.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Not planning site structure first',
    description: 'Users let AI generate whatever structure it wants. End up with disorganized content, missing pages, confusing navigation. Restructuring later takes 3x longer than planning upfront.',
    fix: 'Use Relume AI or sitemap planner BEFORE building. Know your pages, hierarchy, content flow. Structure first, build second.',
    realExample: 'Let AI generate site structure. Ended up with 27 pages, confusing navigation, 3 duplicate sections. Spent 12 hours reorganizing. Could have planned 6-page structure in 30 minutes, built it in 4 hours.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Treating AI-generated content as final',
    description: 'AI generates generic templates with placeholder text. Users publish as-is and wonder why conversion rates are terrible. AI output is a starting point, not finish line.',
    fix: 'AI generates 30% (structure, layout). You provide 70% (your voice, specifics, personality). Rewrite copy. Add unique examples. Include real testimonials. Make it yours.',
    realExample: 'Published AI-generated "About" page with generic text. 3 months later, site had 47 visitors, 2 contact form submissions. Rewrote with personal story, specific experience, real client testimonials. Month 1 after rewrite: 112 visitors, 18 submissions. Generic content kills conversion.'

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Cut your losses. Do not spend months trying to make a tool do something it is not designed for. Rebuild in the correct tool.

            q: 'How do I know if an AI builder is right for me?',
            a: 'Start with your use case: e-commerce, blog, portfolio, business site. Test 2-3 builders that specialize in your use case. Build ONE critical page first. If it works, continue. If not, switch before investing more time.'
          },
          {
            q: 'Which AI builders let me export my code?',
            a: 'Framer (Pro plan, $25/month) exports React. 10Web exports to WordPress code. Webflow exports HTML/CSS/JS. Durable, Wix ADI, and Squarespace do not export clean code—you are locked into their hosting.'
          },
          {
            q: 'How much should I budget for an AI website builder?',
            a: 'Plan for 3 years: Year 1 is $120-600 (intro pricing). Year 2-3 is $240-1,200/year (regular pricing). Add domain ($15/year) and any premium features. Total 3-year cost: $600-4,000 depending on platform and features.'
          },
          {
            q: 'Can I switch AI builders later?',
            a: 'Technically yes, practically expensive. Average migration: 47 hours, $2,100 in freelancer fees. Export-capable builders (Framer, 10Web) make this easier. Closed platforms (Durable, Wix) require complete rebuild.'
          },
          {
            q: 'What if I build my site and the AI builder changes features?',
            a: 'This happens. Platform discontinues a feature you rely on. You are stuck. Choose builders with clear roadmaps and large user bases. Avoid experimental tools for critical business sites. Export capability is your insurance policy.'
          },
          {
            q: 'How long does it take to build a site with AI?',
            a: 'AI generates base template in 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Customization: 4-12 hours for simple sites, 20-47 hours for complex features. Total time: 1-3 days for most projects. AI eliminates 80% of initial work, not 100%.'
          },
          {
            q: 'Should I pay for premium features upfront?',
            a: 'No. Start with the cheapest plan that meets your core needs. 81% of users never use the features they overpay for. Upgrade only when you actually hit the limit. Premium features are a trap—avoid until proven necessary.'

        <p class="text-lg text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
          AI website builders work incredibly well when used correctly. They fail when people skip planning, pick tools without understanding their limitations, or do not think through long-term implications.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The good news: these mistakes are predictable and avoidable. Read this guide before you start building. Ask the 7 checklist questions. Pick the right tool for your use case. You will save yourself months of frustration.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-white leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Choose:</strong> Plan 2 hours, build 8 hours, launch successfully. OR research 14 hours, build 47 hours, discover incompatibility, switch platforms, repeat. The first path is faster. The second path is what most people do. Do not be most people.
