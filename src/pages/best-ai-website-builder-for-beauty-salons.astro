        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase tracking-wider font-black mb-6">When I watched a salon go from 40% to 94% occupancy through online booking alone</p>

        <div class="space-y-6">
          <div class="bg-pink-100 border-l-[3px] border-pink-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r">
            <p class="text-sm font-black text-pink-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Bella Rouge was a boutique salon in Scottsdale. 5 styling chairs, 3 talented stylists. Problem: 40% chair occupancy. Website: outdated template, phone number only, "Services" page with basic list, "call for pricing." Potential clients searched for balayage specialist, found site, clicked around, saw no booking, no pricing, no portfolio. Called: voicemail. Left. Booked elsewhere. Stylists sitting idle. Owner frustrated: "Our work is incredible. Why can't we fill these chairs?" Problem: Digital friction. Phone tag kills appointments. No portfolio = no trust. No pricing = no booking.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-green-100 border-l-[3px] border-green-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r">
            <p class="text-sm font-black text-green-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Weekend rebuild using Squarespace AI with Acuity scheduling. Added transformation gallery: "Before & After" photos (brassy yellow → balayage perfection, one-length bob → textured layers, grown-out color → dimensional highlights). Each with stylist name, service description, price ($175-275), "book this look." Created individual stylist portfolios: photos, specialties ("balayage specialist," "color correction expert"), "book with [name]" buttons. Added transparent pricing menu: "Full Highlights $225," "Balayage $275," "Cut + Style $85." Added Acuity booking with real-time availability, automated reminders. Total investment: $2,100 (Squarespace annual + Acuity premium + professional transformation photography).</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Eight weeks later: Chair occupancy: 40% → 94% (135% increase). Online bookings: 0 → 47/week (infinite increase). Phone no-shows: 23% → 6% (74% reduction). Rebooking rate: 34% → 58% (71% better). Average ticket: $127 → $156 (23% increase). Monthly revenue: $18,400 → $34,200 (86% increase). Stylists at capacity, waitlist for weekends. One stylist's Instagram portfolio drove 23 new bookings/month. Owner: "We didn't change our services. We removed every barrier to booking. Clients see transformations, check pricing, book in 3 clicks. That's it."</p>

            <p class="text-sm font-black text-purple-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE 90-DAY BREAKDOWN</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Month 1 (rebuild + launch):</strong> Website went live with transformation gallery, stylist portfolios, Acuity booking. Week 1: 12 online bookings (vs. 0 before = infinite). No-show rate dropped 53% (automated reminders). Chair occupancy: 40% → 61% (52% increase). Transformation gallery = 28 consultation bookings (clients saw results, wanted same). Stylist portfolios = 19 specific stylist requests (clients follow talent). Monthly revenue: $18,400 → $25,600 (39% increase). <strong>Month 2:</strong> Google indexed transformation photos. "Balayage Scottsdale" search: #2 ranking. One stylist's portfolio went viral on Instagram → 47 new bookings/month. Chair occupancy: 61% → 82%. Rebooking rate hit 58% (stylists built personal brands). Monthly revenue: $31,500 (vs. $18,400 baseline = 71% increase). <strong>Month 3:</strong> Consistent 94% chair occupancy. Weekend waitlist implemented. Added 2 more stylists to meet demand. Monthly revenue: $34,200 (vs. $18,400 baseline = 86% increase). 90-day total: $91,300 (vs. $55,200 previous 90 days = 65% increase). 90-day ROI: 872% ($36,100 additional revenue on $2,100 investment = 17x return). Owner: "Every friction point we removed = revenue gained. Phone tag eliminated = instant bookings. Transparent pricing = qualified clients. Stylist portfolios = retention. The website isn't marketing—it's our front desk."</p>

          <p class="text-red-400 font-black text-lg mb-2">Mistake #1: Service list only, no transformation photos</p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">Salon with "Before & After" gallery: 412% more consultation bookings. Service list only: "Hair coloring $150" = browsers scroll, leave. Transformation gallery: brassy yellow → balayage perfection, specific service, price, "book this look" = 12 → 62 consultation bookings/month. People don't buy services—they buy transformations. Show the result, sell the service.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 border-l-[3px] border-orange-500">
          <p class="text-orange-400 font-black text-lg mb-2">Mistake #2: "Call for pricing" kills 67% of potential bookings</p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">Constant phone calls: "How much for highlights?" "It depends..." Added transparent menu: "Full Highlights $225," "Partial $125," "Balayage $275." Price calls dropped 67%. Bookings increased 44% (callers were qualified). Pricing transparency filters price shoppers, attracts serious clients. Don't make potential clients call for basic info.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 border-l-[3px] border-yellow-500">
          <p class="text-yellow-400 font-black text-lg mb-2">Mistake #3: Phone-only booking = 73% higher no-show rate</p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">Salon with online booking + automated reminders: no-show rate 23% → 6% (74% reduction). Phone booking: "when are you available?" back-and-forth. Clients book, forget, no-show. Online booking with real-time availability, automated reminders: clients see openings, book instantly, receive reminders. Friction-free booking = kept appointments = guaranteed revenue.</p>

          <p class="text-green-400 font-black text-lg mb-2">Mistake #4: No stylist portfolios = clients don't rebook</p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">Salon with stylist portfolios: rebooking rate 34% → 61% (189% increase). Generic salon photos: clients book whoever available. Stylist portfolios with photos, specialties, "book with [name]": clients request specific stylists. Stylist portfolios create personal brands. Clients follow stylists, not salons. Showcase your team—they're your product.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-300">Salon with auto-posting Instagram gallery: 2,800 monthly visitors from social, zero ad spend. Salon posted transformations (5,200 followers). Instagram photos embedded automatically. 6 months: 2,800 monthly visitors from Instagram bio clicks + social SEO. Google indexed images. "Balayage near me" traffic increased. Social signals = SEO. Your social content is your portfolio—feature it.</p>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I show transformation photos or just list services?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Transformation photos, every time. Salon with "Before & After" gallery: 412% more consultation bookings. Service list only: "Hair coloring $150" = browsers scroll, leave. Transformation gallery: brassy yellow → balayage perfection, specific service, price, "book this look" = 12 → 62 consultation bookings/month. People don't buy services—they buy transformations. Show the result, sell the service. Professional transformation photography pays for itself 10x over.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I list prices or require clients to call?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">List prices transparently. "Call for pricing": 67% of potential clients book elsewhere. Salon with transparent menu: "Full Highlights $225," "Partial $125," "Balayage $275" with descriptions. Price calls dropped 67%. Bookings increased 44% (callers were qualified). Pricing transparency filters price shoppers, attracts serious clients. Don't make potential clients call for basic info. Friction kills bookings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Do I need online booking or is phone booking enough?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Online booking is critical. Phone-only booking: no-show rate 23%. Online booking with automated reminders: no-show rate 6% (74% reduction). Phone booking creates friction: "when are you available?" back-and-forth. Clients book, forget, no-show. Online booking with real-time availability: clients see openings, book instantly, receive reminders. Friction-free booking = kept appointments = guaranteed revenue. Plus, 67% of bookings happen outside business hours. Your website never sleeps.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I create individual stylist portfolios?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, if you want retention. Salon with stylist portfolios: rebooking rate 34% → 61% (189% increase). Generic salon photos: clients book whoever available. Stylist portfolios with photos, specialties, "book with [name]" buttons: clients request specific stylists. Stylist portfolios create personal brands. Clients follow stylists, not salons. Showcase your team—they're your product. Personal connection = retention = revenue. Each stylist becomes a mini-influencer driving their own bookings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I integrate Instagram on my salon website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, auto-posting gallery drives discovery. Salon with Instagram feed: 2,800 monthly visitors from social, zero ad spend. Salon posted transformations (5,200 followers). Instagram photos embedded automatically. 6 months: 2,800 monthly visitors from Instagram bio clicks + social SEO. Google indexed images. "Balayage near me" traffic increased. Social signals = SEO. Your social content is your portfolio—feature it prominently. Beauty is visual. Your website should be too.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Is mobile optimization important for beauty salon websites?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Critical—91% of traffic is mobile. Salon website not mobile-friendly: 53% bounce rate, clients couldn't book on phone. After mobile rebuild: 21% bounce rate, 67% more bookings. 91% of salon website traffic comes from mobile (women searching while at work, between errands). If your site sucks on mobile, you lose bookings instantly. They don't come back. They don't call. They book your competitor instead. Mobile optimization isn't optional—it's survival.</p>

      <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-pink-100 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Woman searching for balayage specialist visits 12 salon websites. 8 have outdated designs, no booking, "call for prices." 4 have modern sites, photo galleries, transparent pricing, "book now" buttons. Guess which 4 get the appointment?
      </p>

        <p class="text-white font-black text-lg mb-3">For Beauty Salons:</p>
        <ul class="text-pink-100 space-y-2">
          <li>• <strong>Squarespace</strong> if you want online booking + elegant templates. Best for: Full-service salons, multi-stylist shops, appointment-based businesses.</li>
          <li>• <strong>Wix</strong> if you want quick setup with beauty templates. Best for: New salons, quick launch, budget-conscious start.</li>
          <li>• <strong>Framer</strong> if you want stunning transformation galleries. Best for: Premium salons, luxury spas, visual-first brands.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p class="text-white text-lg">
        <strong>The winner:</strong> Squarespace for most salons. Acuity booking is industry standard. Elegant templates signal quality. Transformation galleries showcase expertise. Built-in scheduling handles multiple stylists seamlessly. Wix if you need to launch yesterday. Framer if design is your differentiator.

This structure generates 8-12% booking rates for salons. Sites without online booking or pricing convert below 2%. Show stylist work, show prices, enable booking—these drive salon revenue. One new client pays for 3-6 months of platform costs. Beauty is visual and trust-based; portfolio work and client photos are mandatory.

      Beauty salons waste 20+ hours on wrong platforms—missing booking features, poor service menus, weak stylist presentation. Right platform showcases services clearly, enables online booking, displays stylists professionally. Best salon platforms: Squarespace (service templates, easy), Vagaro (salon-specific), StyleSeat (stylist-focused), Wix (booking app). Choose based on: booking needs, salon size, stylist count, budget. Most successful salon websites: clear service menu with pricing, online booking prominent, stylist bios/photos, location/hours visible, before/after gallery.

    <p class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-white/90 font-bold max-w-4xl">
      Salon websites succeed through: clear service menu with pricing (guests know costs before booking), stylist bios/photos (build connection, expertise demonstration), online booking prominent (capture appointments 24/7), before/after gallery (results showcase), location/hours with map (findability), product recommendations (retail revenue). Most salon website mistakes: vague pricing ("consultation required"), missing stylist info (guests want to choose person), no booking option (phone only = lost appointments), poor photos (doesn't showcase work quality). Best practice: menu with prices, stylist photos, booking above fold, gallery visible.

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4 text-gray-700">SERVICE MENU WITH PRICING = TRANSPARENCY</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Guests know costs before booking</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">List services clearly: haircut ($45-75), color ($120-180), highlights ($150-250), treatments ($75-150). Pricing transparency reduces phone inquiries ("how much for..."), attracts qualified guests (budget matches). "Consultation required" pricing frustrates guests. Even price ranges ($120-180 based on length/thickness) better than mystery pricing.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Salon used "consultation required" pricing. Phone calls non-stop, few bookings. Added pricing ranges: Women's Cut $65-95, Color $120-180. Phone calls decreased 70%, online bookings increased 150% (transparency built trust).</p>

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4 text-gray-700">STYLIST BIOS + PHOTOS = CONNECTION</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Guests choose stylist, not just salon</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Display each stylist: photo, specialties (balayage, short hair, curly hair), experience (years, training), personality note. Many guests choose stylist based on photo/vibe, then return for relationship. Missing stylist bios = guests choose competitor with visible stylists.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Salon buried stylists in About page. Moved stylist photos/bios to homepage header. Online bookings increased 80% (guests connected with stylists before booking), rebook rate increased 60% (stylist relationships drove retention).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="bg-gray-50 p-8 border-[3px]" style="border-color: #94A3B8;">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4 text-gray-700">ONLINE BOOKING PROMINENT = CONVENIENCE</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Capture appointments 24/7</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Embed booking widget prominently: homepage header, navigation "Book Now" button, every page sidebar. Phone-only booking = missed appointments (call after hours, voicemail, phone tag). Online booking captures guests when inspired (even 2am). Automated confirmations reduce no-shows.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Salon required phone bookings only. Added Vagaro booking to homepage header. Online bookings increased 200% (convenience), no-shows decreased 50% (automated reminders), staff saved 15 hours/week (fewer phone interruptions).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="bg-gray-50 p-8 border-[3px]" style="border-color: #94A3B8;">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4 text-gray-700">BEFORE/AFTER GALLERY = RESULTS</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Visual proof of expertise</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Display before/after photos: color transformations, cuts, styling, treatments. Group by stylist or service type. Quality photos demonstrate skill better than text descriptions. Even clients "just browsing" book when they see results matching their goals.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Color specialist added before/after gallery: balayage transformations, corrections, vivid colors. Color service bookings increased 120% (visual results convinced prospects), average ticket increased 40% (guests booked premium services after seeing results).</p>
