    finding: 'Bookmark e-commerce is solid but overpriced. Product pages: clean layouts with images, descriptions, variants (size/color), inventory tracking. Cart: smooth ajax cart, persists across pages. Checkout: Stripe/PayPal integration works reliably. Backend: order management, customer database, sales analytics all included. The features work well. The problem: pricing. At $29-99/mo, you\'re paying premium prices for mid-tier features. Compared to 10Web + WooCommerce ($10-20/mo for better e-commerce). Compared to Shopify Basic ($29/mo for industry-leading e-commerce). Bookmark is priced like Shopify but offers less. The value equation doesn\'t work unless you\'re specifically tied to Bookmark\'s template ecosystem. For everyone else: better options exist for less money.',

    finding: 'Bookmark templates are good but not $99/mo good. Design quality: clean, modern, professional layouts. Mobile responsive: works well, no broken elements. Customization: decent options but not Framer-level control. Compared to Framer ($15/mo): Framer templates are more modern, better animations, cleaner code export. At 6x the price, Bookmark should blow Framer away - it doesn\'t. Compared to Squarespace ($23/mo): Squarespace templates are more polished, better variety, industry-leading design. Bookmark is 4x the price for template quality that\'s "good but not great." The pricing suggests premium product but templates are mid-tier.

    title: 'Value Calculation: What $99/Mo Should Get You',
    description: 'Analyzed what $99/mo should include based on competitors. Calculated Bookmark\'s actual value vs price.',
    finding: 'At $99/mo ($1188/year), Bookmark should include: best-in-class templates (no), premium hosting (maybe), advanced e-commerce (no), unlimited everything (no). Reality: basic e-commerce, mid-tier templates, limited customization. Competitors at similar price: Shopify ($29/mo for best e-commerce), Webflow Enterprise ($42/mo for best design/code), Wix Business ($46/mo for feature-complete). Bookmark\'s pricing is 2015-era thinking from when "AI website builder" sounded expensive and exclusive. In 2024, with Framer at $15/mo and 10Web at $10/mo, $99/mo is laughable. The only way Bookmark makes sense: you\'ve used it for years, your entire business is built on it, and migrating costs more than staying. That\'s lock-in, not value.',

Result: filled a template with my content - no design intelligence, just text placement. Template process: browsed library, picked a template, replaced content. Result: better design because I chose the best template instead of getting assigned one randomly. The AI doesn\'t add value - it\'s a template chooser with extra steps. Bookmark\'s AI is marketing, not substance. If you use Bookmark, skip the AI generator, browse templates, pick what looks best. Same result in half the time. The AI exists to claim "AI builder" status, not because it improves outcomes.',

    title: 'Migration Cost Analysis',
    description: 'Calculated the cost of migrating from Bookmark to a cheaper platform vs staying with Bookmark. At what point does leaving make sense?',
    finding: 'The migration math favors leaving after year 1. Year 1 Bookmark cost: $588-1188. Migration cost: freelancer $500-1500 to rebuild site. Year 2+ Bookmark: $588-1188 annually. Year 2+ cheaper platform: $180-240 annually (Framer at $15/mo). Break-even: year 2. By year 3, you\'ve saved $300-900 by migrating. The lock-in argument: "migrating is expensive" - true once, false thereafter. Bookmark counts on businesses being too lazy to migrate. But if you run the numbers: paying $500-1500 once saves $400-950 every year thereafter. That\'s smart business, not just "saving money." The only reason to stay at $99/mo: your site makes 6+ figures and the migration risk isn\'t worth $400/year savings. At that scale, hire someone to migrate properly and stop overpaying Bookmark.',

  <!-- DETAILED TESTING SCENARIOS -->
  <section class="py-16 bg-white">
    <div class="container mx-auto px-4 max-w-5xl">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Real-World E-commerce Testing</h2>

      <div class="space-y-8">
        <!-- Scenario 1 -->
        <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-emerald-50 to-teal-50 border-[3px] border-emerald-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Scenario 1: Handmade Jewelry Brand</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4 font-black">Small e-commerce, price-sensitive</p>

          <div class="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Jewelry artist needing 25 products, photo galleries, Stripe checkout, shipping calculator</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> AI generated product descriptions from photos (actually impressive). Catalog worked well</p>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Client saw pricing: $99/mo for inventory features. "That's 5 sales per month just to break even on the platform fee."</p>
            <p><strong>Migration:</strong> Moved to 10Web + WooCommerce. Same features. $20/mo. Client saves $948/year.</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <span class="text-red-600 font-bold">Wrong price point</span>. Features are solid, but pricing kills it for small businesses.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Scenario 2 -->
        <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-50 to-pink-50 border-[3px] border-purple-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Scenario 2: Fashion Brand Startup</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4 font-black">Design-conscious e-commerce</p>

          <div class="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Fashion brand needing bold design, video backgrounds, editorial-style product pages</p>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Bookmark has ~8 e-commerce templates. All basic grid layouts. No video backgrounds</p>
            <p><strong>Client feedback:</strong> "This looks like every other online store. We need something unique."</p>
            <p><strong>Comparison:</strong> Squarespace has 100+ e-commerce templates with editorial layouts. Framer has world-class design</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <span class="text-amber-600 font-bold">Template library too small</span>. 8 options isn't choice for serious brands.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Scenario 3 -->
        <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-indigo-50 border-[3px] border-blue-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Scenario 3: Digital Products Store</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4 font-black">Downloads, not shipping</p>

          <div class="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Course creator selling downloadable PDFs, video courses, digital templates</p>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Bookmark is built for physical products. Shipping, inventory, weight calculations everywhere</p>
            <p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Hid shipping fields, marked everything as "digital only". Still felt clunky</p>
            <p><strong>Alternative:</strong> Framer + Gumroad handles digital products natively. Better user experience</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <span class="text-red-600 font-bold">Physical-product focus</span>. Wrong tool for digital stores.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Scenario 4 -->
        <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-amber-50 to-orange-50 border-[3px] border-amber-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Scenario 4: High-Volume E-commerce (50+ Products)</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4 font-black">Where Bookmark might actually make sense</p>

          <div class="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Established brand with $100K+ revenue, 50+ products, needs full-featured e-commerce with inventory tracking</p>
            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> At this scale, $99/mo is 1% of revenue. Platform fee becomes noise</p>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> But even at scale, 10Web + WooCommerce offers MORE features for $20/mo</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <span class="text-gray-600 font-bold">Still hard to recommend</span>. Even six-figure businesses should care about $79/month premium.</p>
            <p><strong>Honest take:</strong> I can only recommend Bookmark if you literally need AI-generated catalogs and refuse to learn WooCommerce. That's a tiny niche.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Feature Deep Dive: What Actually Works</h2>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="border-l-4 border-emerald-500 pl-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">AI Product Generation (The One Real Strength)</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            Bookmark's AI actually shines here. Upload product photos, enter basic details, and it generates descriptions, categories, pricing suggestions. For a store with 100+ products, this saves legitimate time. Is it worth $79/month premium? That's the math you need to do.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
            <strong>Time saved vs 10Web:</strong> ~2-3 hours for 50 products<br>
            <strong>Monthly savings worth:</strong> At $50/hour = $100-150 one-time value<br>
            <strong>Monthly premium:</strong> $79 forever<br>
            <strong>ROI:</strong> Negative after month 2
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Inventory Management (Solid But Basic)</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            Track stock levels, low inventory alerts, variant management (size/color). All work as expected. But WooCommerce has been doing this for 15 years with more advanced features. Bookmark isn't offering anything new—just the same basics in a prettier interface.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
            <strong>Variant support:</strong> Yes (size, color, etc.)<br>
            <strong>Low stock alerts:</strong> Yes<br>
            <strong>Advanced features:</strong> No (no bundles, no dynamic pricing)
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Checkout & Payments (Stripe/PayPal Only)</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            Stripe and PayPal integration works. Setup is straightforward. But that's table stakes in 2025—every e-commerce platform has this. 10Web + WooCommerce supports 100+ payment gateways including local options. Bookmark is limited.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
            <strong>Stripe:</strong> ✓ Yes<br>
            <strong>PayPal:</strong> ✓ Yes<br>
            <strong>Other gateways:</strong> ✗ No (this is limiting)
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-4 border-rose-500 pl-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Template Library (Critical Weakness)</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            ~8 e-commerce templates. That's it. For a platform charging $99/month, this is insulting. Squarespace has 100+ e-commerce templates. Shopify has a massive theme ecosystem. Bookmark gives you 8 options and calls it a day.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
            <strong>Template count:</strong> ~8 e-commerce<br>
            <strong>Customization depth:</strong> Medium<br>
            <strong>Uniqueness factor:</strong> Low (everyone uses same 8 templates)
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-4 border-amber-500 pl-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Lock-In (No Code Export)</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            Your store is trapped on Bookmark. No code export, no migration tools. If you outgrow the platform, you're rebuilding from scratch. At $99/month, this risk is real. 10Web runs on WordPress—portable, extensible, future-proof.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
            <strong>Code export:</strong> ✗ No<br>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          You've used Bookmark for 3+ years. Your entire business is built on it. 
          All your product URLs are indexed. Your team knows the platform. Migrating 
          would cost $2,000+ and disrupt operations.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-orange-600">
          Reality: You're not staying because Bookmark is great. You're staying 
          because leaving is expensive. That's lock-in, not loyalty.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          You found one Bookmark template that perfectly matches your brand. You've 
          customized it heavily. You don't care about code export. You just want it 
          to work.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-red-600">
          Reality: Framer has better templates. But if you're already invested in 
          Bookmark and don't want to rebuild, staying makes sense—for now.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          You started with Bookmark because you saw an ad. You didn't research 
          alternatives. Now you have 50 products and switching sounds scary.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-orange-600">
          Reality: You're overpaying by $70-79/month. That's $840-948/year. 
          A freelancer can migrate you to 10Web + WooCommerce for $500-800. 
          You'll save money within 8-11 months. Run the math.

        THE BOTTOM LINE ON BOOKMARK
      </h3>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        Bookmark isn't a bad product. The e-commerce works. The templates are decent. 
        The site builder is functional. The problem is the pricing. At $99/month, 
        Bookmark costs more than Shopify while offering less. It costs 6x more than 
        Framer while having worse design.
      </p>
      <p class="text-2xl font-black" style="color: #F5521A;">
        Bookmark's pricing is stuck in 2015, when "AI website builder" sounded 
        premium and exclusive. In 2025, with superior options at 1/3 to 1/6 the price, 
        Bookmark only makes sense if you're already locked in. Everyone else: 
        choose literally anything else.

**Skip Bookmark AI if:**

- Your budget is very tight (but even then, Durable is better)

- Better alternatives: $9-35/month
- **Bookmark AI costs MORE for LESS**

**OUR RECOMMENDATION:**
→ Skip Bookmark AI. Use **Durable** (faster, cheaper, better) or **Squarespace** (better design, similar price).
