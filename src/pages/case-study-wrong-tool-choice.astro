          It was 2 AM on a Tuesday. I'd been on Zoom calls for 8 hours, staring at a blank Figma canvas, watching the cursor blink at me like it was judging my life choices.

          The client email was still open in another tab:

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I should've said yes. $8,000 for a landing page is good money. But I was tired. My brain was fried. And that's when I saw the ad:

          28 seconds later, I had a website. It wasn't great. The colors were weird. The copy said "Streamline your workflow" three times in one paragraph. But it was <strong>done</strong>.

          Sarah was thrilled. The founder was thrilled. I sent the invoice: $8,000. They paid immediately.

          Each request added hours. Each "simple change" required workarounds. I was spending more time fighting the tool than I would've spent just building in Framer or Webflow from the start.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">

          "I don't understand," she said. "I thought we were done? Why do we need to rebuild?"

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            "We outgrew the tool," I said. Which was true. But what I didn't say was: <strong>I chose the wrong tool from the start.</strong>

          I would've been done in 4 weeks. For $25,000. Instead, I spent 10 weeks total and charged them $47,000 for work that should've cost half that.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-6">So... Should You Use AI Builders?</h2>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Yes. But not for everything.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>Durable AI</strong> is still my go-to for:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>• MVPs and landing pages (when speed matters more than anything)</li>
          <li>• Local businesses that will never need more than 5 pages</li>
          <li>• Testing ideas before committing to custom build</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>But I'll never make the same mistake again.</strong> Now I ask: "What happens when this works?" Because <em>of course</em> it's going to work. And then they'll want more. And your tool needs to be ready for "more."
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          $47,000 is an expensive lesson. But it's one I'll never forget.

  </h2>
  <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-white/90 max-w-4xl">
    Brutal honest case study: I chose the wrong AI website builder, spent $12,000 migrating. Here's what went wrong and how you can avoid my mistake.

    <h3 class="text-5xl md:text-6xl font-black mb-8 warning-text">THE MISTAKE</h3>
    
    <div class="bg-red-50 border-[3px] warning-border p-8 mb-12">
      <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4">💬 WHAT HAPPENED</h4>
      <p class="text-lg">
        <strong>Two years ago, I needed a website for my consulting business.</strong> Saw an ad for an AI builder (let's call it "Builder X"), loved the "generate in 30 seconds" pitch. Signed up for annual plan ($312/year). Built site in an hour, launched same day. Thought I was genius for being so efficient. <span class="font-bold">Six months later, business grew. Needed blog for SEO, wanted e-commerce to sell digital products, needed more customization than Builder X allowed. Wanted to leave. Discovered Builder X doesn't allow code export. Trapped. Had to rebuild entire site from scratch on new platform. Total cost: $12,000 (developer fees + lost time + opportunity cost). Here's what I learned the hard way.</span>
      </p>

      <div class="bg-white p-8 border-[3px] border-red-500">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4 text-red-600">Error #1: Choosing Based on Speed, Not Needs</h4>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>What I did:</strong> "Generate in 30 seconds" sounded amazing. I was in a rush, wanted site NOW.<br/>
          <strong>The problem:</strong> Didn't think about 6-month needs. Blog? E-commerce? Custom features?<br/>
          <strong>The cost:</strong> Platform couldn't scale with my business. Locked in.<br/>
          <strong>The lesson:</strong> Think 12 months ahead. If you anticipate needing features the platform lacks, choose something scalable.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="bg-white p-8 border-[3px] border-orange-500">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4 text-orange-600">Error #2: Ignoring Code Export</h4>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>What I did:</strong> Didn't even check if platform allowed code export. Assumed all platforms do.<br/>
          <strong>The problem:</strong> Builder X has no export. Can't take my site with me.<br/>
          <strong>The cost:</strong> Complete rebuild required ($8,000 developer fee).<br/>
          <strong>The lesson:</strong> Code export is insurance. If platform matters, choose one that lets you export (Webflow, Framer, WordPress).
        </p>

      <div class="bg-white p-8 border-[3px] border-red-500">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4 text-red-600">Error #3: Annual Commitment Too Early</h4>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>What I did:</strong> Saw "save 20% with annual plan" - paid for full year upfront.<br/>
          <strong>The problem:</strong> Discovered platform limitations 3 months in. Couldn't get refund.<br/>
          <strong>The cost:</strong> Stuck for 9 more months or eat the $312.<br/>
          <strong>The lesson:</strong> Start with monthly plan. Test platform for 2-3 months BEFORE committing annually. "Save 20%" is trap if platform is wrong.

      <div class="bg-white p-8 border-[3px] border-orange-500">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4 text-orange-600">Error #4: Not Testing Free Trial Properly</h4>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>What I did:</strong> Generated site, looked okay, paid immediately. Didn't test features.<br/>
          <strong>The problem:</strong> Discovered missing features (blog, e-commerce) AFTER paying.<br/>
          <strong>The cost:</strong> Platform couldn't do what I needed. Forced migration.<br/>
          <strong>The lesson:</strong> Use free trial to test EVERYTHING you'll need. Blog? E-commerce? Booking? Code export? Test before paying.

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4 text-red-600">Error #5: Falling For "Good Enough" Design</h4>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>What I did:</strong> Generated site looked "good enough" for MVP. Didn't care about polish.<br/>
          <strong>The problem:</strong> As business grew, "good enough" looked amateur compared to competitors.<br/>
          <strong>The cost:</strong> Lost trust/c credibility. Had to redesign anyway.<br/>
          <strong>The lesson:</strong> Design quality matters from day one. Clients judge you by your website. "Good enough" = leaving money on table.

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Before choosing any platform, ask:</strong><br/>
          - Will I need a blog? (SEO, content marketing)<br/>
          - Will I sell products? (e-commerce, digital downloads)<br/>
          - Will I need booking/appointments? (consultations, services)<br/>

          <p class="font-bold">💡 If answer is "yes" to any, ensure platform supports it. Builder X couldn't handle blog + e-commerce. Squarespace/Webflow/Framer all do.</p>

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4 text-green-600">✅ Step 2: Check Code Export Policy</h4>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Before committing, ask:</strong><br/>
          - Can I export my code? (Yes/No/Partial)<br/>
          - What format? (HTML/CSS, React, WordPress?)<br/>
          - Is export free or extra cost?<br/>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Use free trial to test EVERYTHING:</strong><br/>
          - Build full site (not just homepage)<br/>
          - Test all features you'll need (blog, e-commerce, forms)<br/>
          - Try customization (ensure you have control)<br/>
          - Check mobile responsiveness<br/>
          - Test page load speed
        </p>
        <div class="bg-green-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-green-500">
          <p class="font-bold">💡 Most platforms offer 14-day free trial. Use it. Build test site. Push platform to its limits. Better to discover limitations during free trial than after paying annual fee.</p>

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4 text-green-600">✅ Step 4: Start Monthly, Go Annual Later</h4>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Resist annual plan "savings":</strong><br/>
          - Pay monthly for first 2-3 months<br/>
          - Ensure platform fits your needs<br/>
          - THEN switch to annual for discount<br/>
          - Most platforms honor prorated upgrade

        <div class="bg-green-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-green-600">
          <p class="font-bold">💡 Saving 20% on annual plan means nothing if platform is wrong. That $50 "savings" cost me $12,000. Monthly first = test before committing.</p>

          <strong>Design isn't vanity - it's credibility:</strong><br/>
          - 75% of users judge credibility by website design<br/>
          - "Good enough" = leaving money on table<br/>
          - Professional design = trust, conversions, pricing power<br/>

        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Sarah was a successful freelance graphic designer earning $80-120K/year. She wanted a professional 
          portfolio website to showcase her work and attract higher-paying clients. She had <span class="font-bold">no technical 
          background</span>, limited budget ($50-100/month), and needed something that looked 
          <span class="underline">absolutely stunning</span> to justify her $150+ hourly rates.
        </p>
        
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6">THE CHOICE:</h4>

          Sarah researched AI website builders and chose <span class="font-bold text-red-600">Durable</span> because:

          <li>"Beautiful templates" - the samples looked impressive</li>
