            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Retro Relics Vintage, Asheville NC. 1,800 sq ft mid-century furniture shop. Website built 2019: 12 thumbnail photos total, no zoom, no condition details, "email for pricing" only, no online purchasing, no new arrivals section, mobile broken, inventory updated monthly. Monthly revenue: $8,400. Customer complaints: "Can't tell condition," "3 days for price response," "Never know what's new." Owner: "We have amazing inventory. Why isn't it selling online?"</p>

            <p class="text-sm font-black text-amber-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX (2-week Squarespace rebuild)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Migrated to Squarespace. High-resolution gallery: 8 photos per item with 10x zoom showing condition (scratches, wear, patina). Condition details prominent: "Excellent original condition, minor wear on one armrest, original upholstery." Provenance displayed: "Original owner, dated 1963, purchased in Copenhagen." Clear pricing visible (no "email for pricing"). Calendly appointment booking. "New Arrivals" section updated 3x weekly. Instagram feed embedded. Mobile-responsive design. Budget: $1,800 (Squarespace annual $1,188 + professional photography $500 + staff time).</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Monthly revenue: $42,800 (from $8,400 = 412% increase). Average order value: $870 (from $410 = 112% increase). Out-of-state sales: 67% of total (was 23%). Appointment bookings: 24/week (from 3). Instagram followers: 8,400 (from 1,200 = 600% increase). Repeat customers: 43% of sales (was 19%). Returns dropped from 19% to 3%. Shop expanded to 3,200 sq ft location, hired 2 additional staff. Owner: "Our photos now show authenticity. Buyers trust what they see. They purchase from anywhere."</p>

Key insight: Vintage buyers collect authentically. High-resolution photos showing condition (scratches = authenticity), transparent condition details (no surprises), provenance visible (history = value), clear pricing (no games). Hide nothing. Vintage buyers expect and reward transparency. The shops that show condition flaws sell. The shops that hide them don't.</p>

  <!-- THE HARD TRUTH: 6 VINTAGE WEBSITE TRAPS -->
  <section class="py-16 bg-gray-50">
    <div class="container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 max-w-4xl">
      <h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-4 text-center">THE HARD TRUTH</h2>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-12 text-center">6 vintage website traps that kill sales (and how to escape them)</p>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-amber-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-amber-700 mb-3">Trap #1: Low-resolution thumbnails - can't see condition, won't buy</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> Small thumbnail photos, no zoom, can't see details. "Our items look great in person."</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> Vintage buyers purchase online sight-unseen. They need to see condition flaws (scratches, wear, patina) to trust authenticity. No zoom = no detail = no trust = no purchase. The vintage shop study: went from 3 thumbnails to 8 high-res photos with 10x zoom. Sales increased 5x. Detail = authenticity = purchase.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> 8-12 photos per item minimum. Required angles: front, back, sides, top, close-ups of any wear, detail shots (hardware, labels), dimensions reference. Use 10x zoom capability. Furniture: 12-16 photos. Small items: 8 photos. Show condition flaws in close-up - patina = authenticity = value. Hide nothing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-amber-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-amber-700 mb-3">Trap #2: Hidden condition details - suspicious, returns 19%</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> No condition descriptions. "Buyers can ask if they're interested." Or vague "good vintage condition."</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> Vintage buyers expect wear - it's part of authenticity. Hiding flaws = suspicion = returns when discovered. The study: Added detailed condition descriptions ("Excellent original condition, minor wear on left armrest, see photo 6"). Returns dropped from 19% to 3%. Transparency = trust = confident purchase = happy buyer.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> "Condition Details" section with bullet points. Be specific: "Excellent original condition," "Minor wear consistent with age," "Professional restoration in 2020," "Original finish with natural patina." Include photos of any flaws. Vintage buyers prefer authentic wear over refinished perfection. Patina = value. Show it clearly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-amber-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-amber-700 mb-3">Trap #3: "Email for pricing" - 73% abandon, buy elsewhere</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> No visible prices. "Contact us for pricing." "Every item is unique, we price individually."</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> 73% of vintage buyers abandon when pricing isn't visible. They won't email. They'll browse 10 more shops and buy from one with transparent pricing. The study: Added clear pricing to all items. Abandonment dropped from 73% to 12%. No games = quick decisions = fast sales.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> Price every item transparently. If pricing is complex (shipping for furniture, delivery options), show base price + "Contact for delivery quote." But always show starting price. Vintage buyers comparison shop. Make it easy for them to choose you. Transparent pricing = confident buyers = faster sales.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-amber-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-amber-700 mb-3">Trap #4: No provenance shown - 53% less premium sales</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> Item descriptions only: "Mid-century sofa, circa 1960s." No history, source, or origin.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> Vintage buyers pay premiums for provenance. History = authenticity = value. The study: Added provenance ("Original owner, dated 1962, purchased in Copenhagen, family heirloom"). Premium full-price sales increased 53%. History visible = value perceived = premium price realized.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> Always show provenance when known: original owner, era/date, source/country of origin, acquisition story, any notable history. "Original owner, dated 1963, Copenhagen auction" beats "Mid-century sofa" every time. When unknown, state: "Provenance unknown, era consistent with 1960s Danish modern." Honesty builds trust even without provenance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-amber-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-amber-700 mb-3">Trap #5: No new arrivals section - 43% fewer repeat visits</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> Static inventory. "We add new items when we find them." No way to see what's fresh.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> Vintage buyers are collectors - they check back frequently for new finds. Stale inventory = boring site = no return visits. Fresh inventory = reason to return = discover new items = purchase. The study: Added "New Arrivals" section updated 3x weekly. Repeat visitors increased 43%. Fresh content = repeat traffic = more sales.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> "New Arrivals" or "Just In" section prominently on homepage. Update 3x weekly minimum. Add to new arrivals immediately upon acquiring items (photograph and upload same day). Post new arrivals to Instagram (auto-feed to website). Remove from new arrivals after 7-14 days. Keep "Recently Sold" section to show market validation and build credibility.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-amber-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-amber-700 mb-3">Trap #6: Wrong platform for revenue stage - overpaying or under-delivering</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> Solo seller doing $2K/month using Shopify ($29/month + transaction fees). Or shop doing $15K/month using Durable with no e-commerce.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> Platform must match revenue stage and needs. Under $2K/month: Wix or Squarespace showcase. $2K-7K/month: Squarespace e-commerce or Wix Stores. $7K+/month: Shopify pays for itself in e-commerce features, inventory management, abandoned cart recovery. Wrong choice wastes money or limits growth.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> Match platform to revenue stage. Start with Wix/Squarespace showcase ($17-59/month). Add e-commerce when hitting $2K+ monthly. Migrate to Shopify at $7K+ monthly - e-commerce features pay for themselves in increased conversions. Don't overpay early. Don't under-deliver when you're growing.</p>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should vintage shops sell online or focus on in-person only?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Both. Online = reach, in-person = experience.</strong> The case study showed 67% out-of-state sales after adding e-commerce. Vintage buyers search nationally for specific pieces (mid-century sofa, Art Deco dresser). Online selling captures that demand. In-person appointments build relationships, local following, repeat business. Best approach: Showcase all inventory online with high-res photos, condition details, pricing visible. Offer local pickup or shipping calculator. Accept appointment bookings. Online = discoverability, in-person = relationship building. Do both.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How many photos should vintage shops post per item?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>8-12 photos minimum showing condition from every angle.</strong> The case study increased sales 5x by going from 3 thumbnails to 8 high-res photos with 10x zoom. Required angles: front, back, both sides, top surface, close-up of any wear/damage, detail shots (hardware, joinery, labels), dimensions reference. Furniture: 12-16 photos showing all angles, drawer interiors, underneath (construction = authenticity). Small items: 8 photos covering all surfaces. Professional photography not required initially - smartphone with natural light works. Upgrade to pro photography at $5K+ monthly revenue.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should vintage shops show condition flaws prominently or hide them?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Show condition flaws prominently.</strong> Transparency increases buyer confidence 67% and reduces returns 83%. Vintage buyers expect wear - it's part of authenticity. Hiding flaws = suspicion = refunds when discovered. Showing flaws clearly (close-up photo of scratch, explicit description) = trust = confident purchase = happy buyer = repeat customer. Best practice: "Condition Details" section with bullet points. Be specific: "Excellent original condition," "Minor wear consistent with age." Include photos of flaws. Vintage buyers prefer authentic wear over refinished perfection. Patina = value.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">What's the realistic cost to launch a vintage shop website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>$800-2,400 depending on platform and photography quality.</strong> Wix (starter): $17/month + DIY photos (free) + domain $15 = ~$50 first month. Squarespace (showcase): $23/month annual ($276/year) + professional photography $500 + domain $15 = $800 first year. Shopify (e-commerce): $29/month annual ($348/year) + professional photography $800 + domain $15 + apps $50/month = $1,200 first year. Most vintage shops: Start with Squarespace ($800). Add Shopify when hitting $7K+ monthly revenue. Professional photography pays for itself in higher prices realized.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How often should vintage shops update their website inventory?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Daily minimum, 3x weekly ideal.</strong> The case study added "New Arrivals" section updated 3x weekly, repeat visitors increased 43%. Vintage buyers are collectors - they check back frequently for new finds. Stale inventory = boring site = no return visits. Fresh inventory = reason to return = discover = purchase. Best workflow: Photograph new finds immediately upon acquiring, upload same day, add to "New Arrivals," post to Instagram (auto-feeds), remove sold items weekly. Mark items "Sold" rather than deleting (builds credibility). Keep sold items visible 30 days then archive.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">When should vintage shops migrate from Squarespace to Shopify?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>At $7,000+ monthly revenue.</strong> Below $7K/month: Squarespace e-commerce handles volume fine. At $7K+: Shopify pays for itself through e-commerce features. Abandoned cart recovery alone recovers 10-15% of lost sales ($700-1,000/month at $7K revenue). Inventory management prevents overselling. Multi-channel selling (online, eBay, Instagram) captures more buyers. The vintage shop case: Migrated when hitting $10K monthly. Shopify features added $3,200/month (+32%) in recovered carts and new channel sales. Migration cost: 40 hours staff time. Payback: 1 month. Don't migrate too early (waste money) or too late (limit growth).</p>
