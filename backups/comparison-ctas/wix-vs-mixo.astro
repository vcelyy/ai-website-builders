For most users, Mixo saves 40-80% on monthly costs. Mixo also has a free plan with no time limit. Wix has a free plan but with more limitations. For budget-conscious users, Mixo is the clear winner."

For AI builders with code export, consider Framer ($15-35/mo) which also has good features and design, or Webflow ($23-59/mo) for complete control."

          "text": "Mixo generates complete sites in under 60 seconds with AI-written content ready to publish. Wix ADI takes 2-5 minutes plus time for customization. But the real speed difference is decision fatigue: Mixo has good templates, you pick one and go. Wix has 800+ templates, you spend hours browsing. The consultant spent 2 hours just choosing Wix templates. Mixo: 23 minutes total to launch. Speed comes from focus, not just generation time."

The fitness instructor needed all of these—Wix handled everything for $54/month. Mixo would have required 5-7 external services totaling $66/month.

The consultant's simple site needed none of Wix's features—she wasted $624/year on unused apps. 80% of sites don't need Wix's feature depth. Start with Mixo, upgrade only if you hit limitations."

          "text": "Wix has more templates (800+) but Mixo templates are modern and clean. Wix templates range from excellent to dated—you need to choose carefully. Mixo templates are consistently good but fewer options. For most users, Mixo's focused template library is easier than Wix's overwhelming choice. Unless you need a very specific industry template that only Wix offers, Mixo's templates work great."

Wix (7.5/10 AI) has Wix ADI, AI Text Generator, AI Section Creator—but they feel like add-ons to a traditional builder. Mixo is AI-native from the start. For AI-powered site building, Mixo delivers better results faster."

Same for Wix to Mixo. The consultant switched from Wix to Mixo after realizing she wasn't using the features—took 6 hours to migrate. But she saves $624/year going forward. Migration is painful but pays off if you're genuinely overpaying."

      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Speed & Setup</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
          <strong>Mixo is lightning fast.</strong> Generate complete sites in under 60 seconds with AI content ready to publish.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          <strong>Wix takes more time.</strong> ADI generates a site in 2-5 minutes, plus time for customization. More powerful but slower.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Features & Flexibility</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
          <strong>Wix is feature-rich.</strong> 500+ apps, advanced e-commerce, booking systems, memberships. You can build almost anything.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          <strong>Mixo is focused.</strong> Does websites well but lacks advanced features. No app marketplace, simpler e-commerce.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Pricing Reality</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
          <strong>Mixo is budget-friendly.</strong> $9/month flat with all features included. Simple, predictable pricing.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          <strong>Wix gets expensive.</strong> $16-45/month depending on features. Premium tiers add up quickly for e-commerce.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Maturity vs. Innovation</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
          <strong>Wix is established.</strong> 20+ years of development. Reliable, well-documented, huge community.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          <strong>Mixo is newer.</strong> AI-focused from the start. Modern approach but fewer features and less maturity.

        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A consultant needed a simple site: bio, services, testimonials, contact form, blog for articles. Same content, same goals. Tested both platforms for 6 months.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Mixo:</strong> Generated in 51 seconds. AI wrote professional copy. Added testimonial section. Blog setup with SEO. Total time: 23 minutes. Monthly cost: $9.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Wix:</strong> ADI generated a site in 3 minutes. But she spent 2 hours browsing 500+ templates. Finally chose one, customized fonts/colors. Added bookings app ($17/mo) because she "might need it later." Added Ascend email marketing ($13/mo) for future newsletters. Added forms app ($10/mo) for advanced form fields. Total monthly cost: $16 base + $40 in add-ons = $56/month.</p>
          <div class="bg-emerald-100 border-l-[4px] border-emerald-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-emerald-900 font-medium"><strong>6 months later:</strong> Mixo site generated 143 leads. Wix site generated 147 leads. Statistically identical 4-lead difference.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">But she never used the bookings app (she handles bookings via email). Never sent a newsletter (too busy). Never used advanced form fields. She paid $40/month for features she didn't need.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-emerald-900 font-medium"><strong>The cost:</strong> Mixo: $9 x 6 = $54 total. Wix: $56 x 6 = $336 total. That's $282 more over 6 months for the same results. Annualized: $624/year wasted on unused features.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">She switched to Mixo. "I fell for the feature trap. Thought I'd need bookings and email marketing. Never used them once. Mixo does everything I actually need."</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-teal-900 font-medium"><strong>The counter-scenario:</strong> A fitness instructor needed bookings, payments, video hosting, membership areas, nutrition tracking. Mixo couldn't handle it—would need 5-7 external services. Wix handled everything: Wix Bookings ($17/mo), Wix Paid Memberships ($25/mo), video hosting built-in, payment processing integrated.

            <p class="text-sm text-cyan-900 font-medium"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> Most people overestimate their feature needs. The consultant wasted $624/year on apps she never used. But the fitness instructor genuinely needed Wix's ecosystem. The consultant switched to Mixo and saved $624/year. The fitness instructor stayed on Wix and saved $12/month vs. separate services. Both made the right choice after testing. Be honest about what you need, not what you might need.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Is Wix or Mixo better for website building?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Mixo (8.5/10) is faster, easier, and more affordable at $9/month vs Wix's $16-45/month. Mixo generates sites in under 60 seconds. Wix (8.2/10) offers more features and maturity but takes longer and costs more. Mixo is better for quick launches and simple sites. Wix is better for complex sites needing many features. Choose Mixo for speed and value, Wix for features.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[2px] border-gray-200 p-6 hover:border-[#14B8A6] transition-colors">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Which is cheaper, Wix or Mixo?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Mixo is significantly cheaper at $9/month flat compared to Wix's $16-45/month. Mixo's single plan includes all features. Wix has multiple tiers with increasing costs. For most users, Mixo saves 40-80% on monthly costs. Mixo also has a free plan with no time limit. Wix has a free plan but with more limitations. For budget-conscious users, Mixo is the clear winner.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[2px] border-gray-200 p-6 hover:border-[#14B8A6] transition-colors">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Why is Mixo faster than Wix?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Mixo generates complete sites in under 60 seconds with AI-written content ready to publish. Wix ADI takes 2-5 minutes plus time for customization. But the real speed difference is decision fatigue: Mixo has good templates, you pick one and go. Wix has 800+ templates, you spend hours browsing. The consultant spent 2 hours just choosing Wix templates. Mixo: 23 minutes total to launch. Speed comes from focus, not just generation time.</p>

        <div class="bg-white border-[2px] border-gray-200 p-6 hover:border-[#14B8A6] transition-colors">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">When should I choose Wix over Mixo?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Choose Wix if you need: e-commerce with inventory management, booking systems for appointments, membership areas and paid content, video hosting built-in, advanced form features, 500+ apps for specific needs. The fitness instructor needed all of these—Wix handled everything for $54/month. Mixo would have required 5-7 external services totaling $66/month. If you genuinely need complex features, Wix's app ecosystem is worth the extra cost.</p>
        </div>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">When should I choose Mixo over Wix?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Choose Mixo if you need: simple site fast, lowest price ($9 vs $16-56), bio/services/contact/blog structure, landing pages, portfolio sites, startup on budget. The consultant's simple site needed none of Wix's features—she wasted $624/year on unused apps. 80% of sites don't need Wix's feature depth. Start with Mixo, upgrade only if you hit limitations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[2px] border-gray-200 p-6 hover:border-[#14B8A6] transition-colors">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Does Wix have better templates than Mixo?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Wix has more templates (800+) but Mixo templates are modern and clean. Wix templates range from excellent to dated—you need to choose carefully. Mixo templates are consistently good but fewer options. For most users, Mixo's focused template library is easier than Wix's overwhelming choice. Unless you need a very specific industry template that only Wix offers, Mixo's templates work great.</p>

        <div class="bg-white border-[2px] border-gray-200 p-6 hover:border-[#14B8A6] transition-colors">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I switch from Mixo to Wix later?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Technically yes, but it's manual migration. Export your content and images from Mixo, rebuild in Wix. No automated import—plan for a full day of migration work. Same for Wix to Mixo. The consultant switched from Wix to Mixo after realizing she wasn't using the features—took 6 hours to migrate. But she saves $624/year going forward. Migration is painful but pays off if you're genuinely overpaying.</p>
