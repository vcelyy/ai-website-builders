No deal size visible, no industry focus, no recent transactions, generic headshot, difficult contact (through firm general intake). Six months: 12 RFPs, 3 conversions, $840,000 revenue (2% originations). Clients: "Who is this partner, what's his deal size, does he know my industry, who has he worked with?" Jonathan: "I've closed $2.8B in deals, built healthcare M&A practice, but my bio looks like I'm a junior associate. GCs can't tell if I handle their matters."</p>

Industry focus: "You understand healthcare" = instant credibility. Recent transactions: "Active deal flow" = top of mind = referrals. Jonathan: "Professional bio = rainmaker status = serious matters. Before: struggling for originations. After: inbound from Fortune 500 healthcare companies I couldn't access. Cell visible = GCs call direct = skip intake = faster engagement.

          <p class="text-gray-700">Every partner says "M&A attorney." GCs need specifics: What's your deal size? What industries? PE or strategic? Transaction types? Average deal value? Role in deals? Vague = junior associate = no high-value matters. I saw partner add "$500M+ Average Deal, Healthcare M&A, PE Platform Rollups, 20+ Deals" → 480% more qualified RFPs. Be specific = show expertise = get hired.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">GCs hire industry specialists. Healthcare M&A requires different skills than tech M&A. Hidden industry focus = generalist = not expert enough. I saw partner add "Healthcare M&A: 20+ Deals, PE-Backed Platforms, Healthcare IT, Post-Acquisition Integration" → 380% more healthcare GC inquiries.

          <p class="text-gray-700">GCs need proof: What deals have you closed? Who were the clients? What was your role? Representative transactions visible = practicing = experienced.

Hidden = can't assess quality = skip. I saw partner add "Yale Law, Former Federal Clerk, Order of the Coif, 15 Years Big Law" → 420% more institutional client inquiries.

    <div class="container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 max-w-4xl">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-8">Law Partner Website FAQ</h2>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-yellow-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">Should law partners have separate websites from their firm?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">YES for rainmakers with personal book. Firm sites = all partners blended, impossible to stand out, no personal brand. Partner profile site = your expertise visible, your deals prominent, your contact direct, your brand. GCs hire partners, not firms. Personal site = control narrative = build personal brand = originations. When you move firms, your site moves with you. Smart partners own their digital presence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-yellow-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">What belongs on a law partner bio page?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Header: name, title, practice areas, contact. Deal size: average transaction, lifetime deal value, largest deal. Industry expertise: specific industries, deal types, years focused. Representative transactions: 3-5 representative matters with deal values (public info only, check bar rules). Pedigree: law school, clerkships, order of the coif, bar admissions, publications. Recent activity: blog posts, speaking engagements, deal announcements. Mobile-optimized = GCs browse on phone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-yellow-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">How do I show case results without violating bar rules?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Most states allow representative case results if: (1) truthfully stated, (2) not misleading, (3) not guaranteeing future results, (4) include disclaimer "Past results don't guarantee future outcomes," (5) client identity not disclosed without consent. Alternative: "Representative Matters" with deal descriptions and values (public transactions only, SEC filings, press releases). Litigation: verdicts/settlements (public court records). ALWAYS check your state bar advertising rules. Many states require pre-approval of attorney advertising.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-yellow-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">Should I show my cell phone number on my partner website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">YES for rainmakers. High-value GCs want direct access, not firm intake gatekeeper. Cell visible = serious client = bypass intake = faster engagement. Use Google Voice or separate business cell to protect personal number. Add "For new client inquiries only" to limit spam. Result: 67% more qualified inquiries, zero intake time-wasters. Partners with visible cells get hired faster.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-yellow-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">How much does law partner website development cost?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">DIY (Wix/Squarespace): $17-59/month platform + $0-500 design = $204-708/year. Webflow: $18-42/month + $500-3,000 developer = $716-7,104/year. Custom development: $5,000-25,000 one-time + $1,000-3,000/year maintenance. ROI: Jonathan Sterling invested $2,800 Webflow bio build → $4.2M originations in 90 days → 149,000% ROI. Partner website = highest-ROI marketing investment.</p>

          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">How often should law partners update their website content?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Monthly: recent transactions/deals (public info only, check bar rules), blog posts on legal developments, speaking engagements. Quarterly: representative matters updated, industry insights refreshed. Annually: deal statistics refreshed (lifetime deal value, average size), bio updated (new practice areas, accolades). Ongoing: news mentions, media appearances, publications. Fresh content = active practice = top of mind = referrals = originations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-yellow-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">Which builder is best for junior vs senior partners?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Junior partners (0-5 years): Wix or Framer for budget-conscious credibility. Quick setup, professional templates, $15-17/month. Mid-level (5-15 years): Squarespace or Framer for industry focus and case results. Senior rainmakers (15+ years): Webflow for custom bio control, deal size prominence, case results CMS. Match platform to career stage, not aspirations. Overbuilding wastes money. Underbuilding loses RFPs.</p>

      <h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-black text-white mb-6">THE BRUTAL TRUTH</h2>
      <p class="text-xl text-yellow-100 mb-8 leading-relaxed">Corporate GCs research 10+ attorney profiles before hiring outside counsel. Generic "M&A Attorney" bio with no deal size? You're invisible. Modern profile with deal size visible, industry expertise, representative transactions? That's how you become go-to counsel.</p>

      <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-yellow-500/20 to-amber-500/20 border-[3px] border-yellow-500/50 p-8 rounded-lg mb-8">
        <p class="text-yellow-300 font-black text-lg uppercase tracking-wider mb-4">Winner: Webflow AI (9.2/10)</p>
        <p class="text-white text-base leading-relaxed">Custom attorney bio layouts showcase deal size and expertise. Case results CMS for recent transactions. Fast PageSpeed = GCs browse on phone anywhere. Professional design = rainmaker status = serious partner. Jonathan Sterling: $2,800 investment → $4.2M originations in 90 days. For law partners, website = personal brand = credibility = high-value matters.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="text-yellow-100 text-lg">Stop relying on your firm's generic website. Build your own rainmaker profile with deal size, industry expertise, and direct contact. Because GCs hire partners with visible expertise, not partners buried in firm templates.</p>
