          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "AI website builders are absolutely sufficient for most K-12 schools, teachers, and educational uses. Modern AI builders create professional educational websites with calendar integration, parent communication features, secure forms, media galleries, and all key functionality. Large universities with complex student portal systems, custom LMS integration, and hundreds of department sites may need custom development. For 95% of educational institutions, AI builders provide professional results at a fraction of the cost and time of custom development. Your website should serve parents and students with easy access to information - not impress with complex technology. Focus on: updated calendar, clear contact info, accessible announcements, mobile optimization, and current information. AI builders handle all of this beautifully."

          "text": "School websites have critical privacy obligations: (1) COPPA compliance for students under 13 - additional protections apply, (2) Photo release forms required before publishing student images, (3) Never publish full addresses, phone numbers, or detailed schedules of students, (4) Use first names only with written parental permission, (5) Secure contact forms for parent communication, (6) Password-protected areas for sensitive internal information, (7) Clear privacy policy explaining data collection and use, (8) Limited data collection - only what's necessary, (9) Regular security updates and monitoring, (10) Staff training on privacy policies. Consult legal counsel for privacy policy creation. When in doubt, be conservative with student information. Better to under-share than expose students to risk."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Teachers can create effective classroom websites for minimal cost using AI builders. Budget options: Mixo at $9/month - generates complete classroom site with calendar, resources, parent contact. Google Sites - completely free with Google account, integrates with Classroom and Drive, but limited design flexibility. Wix free tier - functional but displays Wix ads and has limited storage. For $9/month, Mixo provides best value for teachers: clean design, enough features for classroom needs, no ads, professional appearance. key classroom website features: Homework assignments and due dates, class calendar with events and deadlines, resource downloads (worksheets, study guides), parent contact form, class announcements and news, student work showcase (with privacy). Keep it simple - update weekly, respond to parent inquiries within 24 hours, ensure mobile access works (parents check on phones during commute). Your time is better spent on teaching than maintaining complex websites."

          "text": "Calendar integration is critical for school websites - parents need event access on mobile. Integration options: Google Calendar embed - free, syncs automatically, mobile-optimized, most AI builders support embed code. Native calendar widgets in Squarespace, Wix, and other builders - easier setup, sometimes costs extra monthly. For parent communication: Newsletter signup forms (Mailchimp, Constant Contact integration), RSS feed for announcements (parents can subscribe), SMS/text for emergency alerts (requires third-party service), Contact forms for general inquiries, Password-protected parent portal areas for sensitive info. Best practice: Google Calendar embed (free, reliable) + simple contact form + newsletter signup for announcements. For emergencies: text alert service (SchoolMessenger, etc.) - separate from website but linked prominently. Focus on mobile access - 85% of parents check school info on phones during work commute or pickup lines."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Universities and colleges can use AI builders, but with important caveats. AI builders work well for: Department websites (academic departments, research labs), Program pages (degree programs, certificates), Event sites (conferences, academic symposiums), Faculty profiles and research showcases, Student organization sites. AI builders may NOT work for: Main university homepage (needs custom branding, complex integration), Student portal systems (require custom authentication, LMS integration), Course catalog and registration (integrated with university systems), Library and research databases (custom database systems). Large universities typically use: Custom main site + AI builders for individual departments and programs. This hybrid approach leverages AI builder speed for department sites while maintaining custom systems for core university functions. For university departments, Webflow's CMS handles complex content needs well. For simple program sites, Squarespace or Framer provide professional results quickly."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "EdTech and online course websites need different features than traditional schools. key features: Course showcase with curriculum and learning outcomes, instructor credentials and expertise, enrollment/signup or registration process, pricing and payment integration, student testimonials and success stories, preview lessons or course samples, LMS integration or platform links, refund policy and guarantees, FAQ covering common questions, mobile-optimized preview experience. Marketing-focused features: Landing page for each course (A/B test conversions), clear value proposition (what students gain), social proof (enrollment numbers, ratings), comparison with competitors (positioning), urgency/scarcity elements (limited spots, enrollment deadline), clear call-to-action above fold. Framer excels for EdTech marketing sites with modern design and fast loading. For course delivery, integrate with platforms like Teachable, Thinkific, or Kajabi rather than building custom LMS functionality. Your website sells the course - let dedicated platforms handle delivery."

For educational institutions, prioritize: calendar integration for school events, parent communication tools, student work showcases (with privacy considerations), staff directory, emergency contact information, and mobile optimization for parents accessing on phones.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do schools need custom websites or are AI builders sufficient?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            AI website builders are absolutely sufficient for most K-12 schools, teachers, and educational uses. Modern AI builders create professional educational websites with calendar integration, parent communication features, secure forms, media galleries, and all key functionality. Large universities with complex student portal systems, custom LMS integration, and hundreds of department sites may need custom development. For 95% of educational institutions, AI builders provide professional results at a fraction of the cost and time of custom development. Your website should serve parents and students with easy access to information - not impress with complex technology. Focus on: updated calendar, clear contact info, accessible announcements, mobile optimization, and current information. AI builders handle all of this beautifully.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">What privacy considerations for school websites?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            School websites have critical privacy obligations: (1) COPPA compliance for students under 13 - additional protections apply, (2) Photo release forms required before publishing student images, (3) Never publish full addresses, phone numbers, or detailed schedules of students, (4) Use first names only with written parental permission, (5) Secure contact forms for parent communication, (6) Password-protected areas for sensitive internal information, (7) Clear privacy policy explaining data collection and use, (8) Limited data collection - only what's necessary, (9) Regular security updates and monitoring, (10) Staff training on privacy policies. Consult legal counsel for privacy policy creation. When in doubt, be conservative with student information. Better to under-share than expose students to risk.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">How do teachers create classroom websites on a budget?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Teachers can create effective classroom websites for minimal cost using AI builders. Budget options: Mixo at $9/month - generates complete classroom site with calendar, resources, parent contact. Google Sites - completely free with Google account, integrates with Classroom and Drive, but limited design flexibility. Wix free tier - functional but displays Wix ads and has limited storage. For $9/month, Mixo provides best value for teachers: clean design, enough features for classroom needs, no ads, professional appearance. key classroom website features: Homework assignments and due dates, class calendar with events and deadlines, resource downloads (worksheets, study guides), parent contact form, class announcements and news, student work showcase (with privacy). Keep it simple - update weekly, respond to parent inquiries within 24 hours, ensure mobile access works (parents check on phones during commute). Your time is better spent on teaching than maintaining complex websites.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">How do schools integrate calendars and parent communication?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Calendar integration is critical for school websites - parents need event access on mobile. Integration options: Google Calendar embed - free, syncs automatically, mobile-optimized, most AI builders support embed code. Native calendar widgets in Squarespace, Wix, and other builders - easier setup, sometimes costs extra monthly. For parent communication: Newsletter signup forms (Mailchimp, Constant Contact integration), RSS feed for announcements (parents can subscribe), SMS/text for emergency alerts (requires third-party service), Contact forms for general inquiries, Password-protected parent portal areas for sensitive info. Best practice: Google Calendar embed (free, reliable) + simple contact form + newsletter signup for announcements. For emergencies: text alert service (SchoolMessenger, etc.) - separate from website but linked prominently. Focus on mobile access - 85% of parents check school info on phones during work commute or pickup lines.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can universities and colleges use AI website builders?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Universities and colleges can use AI builders, but with important caveats. AI builders work well for: Department websites (academic departments, research labs), Program pages (degree programs, certificates), Event sites (conferences, academic symposiums), Faculty profiles and research showcases, Student organization sites. AI builders may NOT work for: Main university homepage (needs custom branding, complex integration), Student portal systems (require custom authentication, LMS integration), Course catalog and registration (integrated with university systems), Library and research databases (custom database systems). Large universities typically use: Custom main site + AI builders for individual departments and programs. This hybrid approach leverages AI builder speed for department sites while maintaining custom systems for core university functions. For university departments, Webflow's CMS handles complex content needs well. For simple program sites, Squarespace or Framer provide professional results quickly.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">What features should EdTech and online course websites include?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            EdTech and online course websites need different features than traditional schools. key features: Course showcase with curriculum and learning outcomes, instructor credentials and expertise, enrollment/signup or registration process, pricing and payment integration, student testimonials and success stories, preview lessons or course samples, LMS integration or platform links, refund policy and guarantees, FAQ covering common questions, mobile-optimized preview experience. Marketing-focused features: Landing page for each course (A/B test conversions), clear value proposition (what students gain), social proof (enrollment numbers, ratings), comparison with competitors (positioning), urgency/scarcity elements (limited spots, enrollment deadline), clear call-to-action above fold. Framer excels for EdTech marketing sites with modern design and fast loading. For course delivery, integrate with platforms like Teachable, Thinkific, or Kajabi rather than building custom LMS functionality. Your website sells the course - let dedicated platforms handle delivery.

        AI builders = marketing website (landing pages, course info, enrollment CTAs).<br/>
        LMS platforms = course delivery (video lessons, quizzes, certificates, student dashboards).<br/>
        You need BOTH: AI builder for marketing, LMS (Teachable, Thinkific) for course delivery.<br/>
        Or use WordPress + LMS plugin for all-in-one solution.<br/>
