## Executive Summary

**TL;DR:** Durable builds sites in 30 seconds. The problem? They look like they were built in 30 seconds. Perfect for testing ideas. Terrible for anything you actually care about.

**The Verdict:** Durable is the instant ramen of website builders—fills the hole, but you don't want to live on it.

## What Durable Does Exceptionally Well

### 1. Speed (11/10) - Insanely fast

**This is Durable's entire value proposition:** You type a prompt, 30 seconds later, you have a website.

**Real example:** I needed a landing page to test a business idea. Typed "AI-powered email marketing tool for small businesses, target audience: e-commerce store owners, key features: automated segmentation, ai-powered subject lines, real-time analytics, price: $29/month."

30 seconds later: Full landing page with hero, features, pricing, testimonials, FAQ, contact form.

**Time saved:** Compared to 2-3 hours in Squarespace or 6-8 hours in Webflow.

**When this matters:**
- Validating business ideas (test before building)
- MVP landing pages (get feedback fast)
- A/B testing (create 10 versions in 5 minutes)
- Temporary sites (events, campaigns)

**The use case:** You have an idea. You want to see if it resonates. Durable gets you there fast.

### 2. AI Writing (8/10) - Surprisingly decent copy

**The AI generates actual marketing copy, not placeholder text.**

**Real example:** Generated a landing page for a fictional SaaS product. The copy included:
- Benefit-focused headlines ("Stop guessing which emails convert")
- Feature descriptions that made sense
- Testimonials that sounded real-ish
- FAQ with relevant questions

**Quality:** 6/10 (not great, but usable)
**Speed:** 10/10 (instant)

**What works:**
- Hero headlines (usually benefit-focused)
- Feature descriptions (adequate for MVP)
- Pricing tables (logical structure)
- Testimonials (generic but believable)

**What doesn't:**
- Nuance or brand voice (all sounds same-y)
- Technical accuracy (made up features once)
- Emotional connection (feels robotic)

**Verdict:** Good for starting point, bad for final product.

### 3. Iteration Speed (9/10) - Make changes instantly

**Want to test different versions? Durable excels here.**

**Real example:** Created 5 versions of a landing page:
1. Focus on "save time"
2. Focus on "increase revenue"
3. Focus on "easy to use"
4. Focus on "AI-powered"
5. Focus on "affordable"

**Total time:** 3 minutes (including typing prompts)
**Same task in Webflow:** Would have taken 2-3 hours

**When this matters:**
- A/B testing headlines
- Testing value propositions
- Exploring different angles
- Getting feedback on multiple versions

## What Durable Does Poorly

### 1. Design Quality (3/10) - Looks generic

**The harsh truth:** Durable sites all look the same. And it's not a good look.

**What makes it generic:**
- Same layout structure (hero → features → pricing → CTA)
- Same color schemes (blue/gradient everything)
- Same typography (basic sans-serif)
- Same imagery (stock photos everywhere)
- Same animations (basic fade-ins)

**Real example:** Generated 10 sites for different industries. All 10 had:
- Full-width hero with gradient overlay
- 3-column feature grid
- Pricing table with 3 tiers
- "Get Started" CTA button (same color, same placement)

**The problem:** Your site looks like every other Durable site. There's zero differentiation.

### 2. Customization (2/10) - Can't fix the ugly

**Want to change something? Good luck.**

**Limitations:**
- Can't move elements freely (stuck in layout)
- Can't change color schemes meaningfully (pick from presets)
- Can't customize typography (limited font choices)
- Can't add custom sections (stuck with template)
- Can't adjust spacing (rigid grid)

**Real example:** Client wanted to move a testimonial section above features. In Durable? Not possible. Would have to regenerate entire site.

**The workaround:** You don't. You regenerate the entire site and hope it looks better.

### 3. SEO (4/10) - Barely functional

**What you get:**
- Basic meta tags (title, description)
- Semantic HTML (h1, h2, etc.)
- Mobile responsive (barely)

**What you don't get:**
- Schema markup (critical for rich snippets)
- Sitemap generation (have to build manually)
- Image optimization (no alt text control)
- Page speed optimization (bloated code)
- Internal linking control (AI decides)

**Real example:** Ran a Durable-generated site through PageSpeed Insights. Score: 42/100. Same site built in Webflow: 92/100.

**Why this matters:** Your site might load. But Google won't love it.

### 4. The "AI" Part is Overhyped (5/10) - It's GPT with a wrapper

**Here's what Durable actually is:** GPT-4 + a template engine + a frontend.

**What this means:**
- The AI doesn't "understand" your business
- It's generating text based on patterns, not strategy
- Same prompt = different results (inconsistent)
- Can't iterate on specific sections (regenerate everything)

**Real example:** Generated a site for "coffee shop in Portland." Regenerated with same prompt. Got completely different layout, copy, everything. No way to say "keep the layout, change the copy."

**The problem:** Lack of control. You're at the mercy of the AI's mood.

### 5. Long-term Viability (2/10) - Not for serious sites

**The brutal truth:** If you care about your business, don't use Durable for your actual website.

**Why:**
- You can't customize it properly
- It looks generic
- SEO is mediocre
- You're locked into their platform
- Scaling is impossible (no CMS, no advanced features)

**Real example:** Friend used Durable for his startup landing page. Got feedback: "Looks... generated?" Switched to Webflow, relaunched in 2 weeks, looked professional, got 3x more signups.

## Final Thoughts

**Durable is a tool, not a solution.**

**Use it for:** Testing ideas, validating concepts, MVPs, temporary sites
**Don't use it for:** Actual businesses, serious brands, anything you care about

**The truth:**
- Fast? Yes (insanely)
- Good quality? No (looks generic)
- AI-powered? Technically yes, but it's a wrapper around GPT
- Worth $15/month? Only if you're constantly testing new ideas
- Long-term viable? No (you'll outgrow it immediately)

**My advice:** Use Durable to validate ideas. When something works, rebuild it properly in Framer, Squarespace, or Webflow. Don't ship Durable sites to customers. Don't build your business on it. It's a testing tool, not a foundation.

**Durable is like a prototype:** Great for figuring out what you want, terrible for living in.

**Rating Breakdown:**
- For MVP testing: 9/10
- For real businesses: 2/10
- Design quality: 3/10
- Customization: 2/10
- Speed: 11/10 (literally unmatched)
- Overall: 4.5/10

**Would I use it again?** Yes, for idea validation only
**Would I recommend it?** Only with caveats (use it to test, not to ship)
**Is it worth $15/month?** Only if you're testing multiple ideas per month
