Wix offers easier usability (8.5/10 vs 8.0/10), massive app marketplace with 5000+ apps for unlimited features, more mature platform with proven reliability, and built-in e-commerce capabilities. Framer is better for: designers wanting stunning modern designs, startups and tech companies, portfolios requiring visual impact, users who want code export option. Wix is better for: users needing specific features from app marketplace, e-commerce businesses, complex websites requiring add-ons, those wanting established platform with maximum features. Choose Framer for beautiful design and flexibility. Choose Wix for maximum features and ease of use."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Framer and Wix have different pricing structures with Framer being significantly more affordable at entry levels. Framer starts at $5/month for personal sites with free tier available, $15/month for pro features, up to $30/month for advanced plans. Over 3 years, Framer costs $180-1080 depending on plan level (or free for basic sites). Wix starts at $10/month for basic sites, $18/month for unlimited plans, up to $46/month for e-commerce and business features. Over 3 years, Wix costs $360-1656 depending on plan level. For basic websites, Framer is half the price ($5 vs $10/month base pricing). For premium features, Framer remains more affordable ($15 vs $18/month). For e-commerce, Wix costs more but offers more advanced features. Framer's aggressive pricing with free tier makes it exceptional value."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Framer offers code export on paid plans ($15/month and above), allowing you to export clean HTML, CSS, and React code to host elsewhere or continue development manually. Wix does NOT offer code export - your website stays on Wix's servers permanently and you're locked into their platform. This is a major difference if you care about owning your code or having flexibility to migrate platforms. With Framer, you can export your code and move to custom development or React hosting when ready. With Wix, you're committed to their platform but get access to a massive app marketplace with 5000+ integrations. If code export matters for your long-term strategy, Framer is the clear winner."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Wix has significantly better e-commerce capabilities than Framer. Wix offers built-in e-commerce with: inventory management, product variants and options, abandoned cart recovery, gift cards and discounts, customer accounts, shipping rate calculation, tax automation, multi-channel selling integrations. Wix e-commerce is powerful enough for serious online stores. Framer offers basic e-commerce features: Gumroad/Lemon Squeezy/Snipcart integrations, simple payment buttons, basic checkout links. Framer's e-commerce is suitable for: digital products, simple merchandise, lead generation with payment options. If you're building a real online store with physical products and inventory, Wix is the clear choice. If you just need to accept payments for digital products or simple services, Framer handles the job."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Wix has a massive app marketplace with 5000+ apps covering virtually any functionality you can imagine. Booking systems, email marketing, CRM, live chat, analytics, membership areas, automation tools - Wix has an app for everything. Most apps offer free tiers with paid upgrades. Framer has no app marketplace - functionality comes through: direct integrations with popular tools (Stripe, Google Analytics), embed codes and iframes, Zapier for connecting to other services, custom React components. The difference is significant: Wix gives you plug-and-play features without code. Framer requires technical setup or custom development for advanced features. If you need extensive functionality without technical work, Wix wins. If you prefer control over every integration, Framer's approach gives you more flexibility."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Framer sites typically load significantly faster than Wix sites. Framer generates optimized code with minimal bloat, resulting in PageSpeed scores of 90-100. Typical Framer sites load in 0.5-1.5 seconds. Wix sites often have heavier code due to feature bloat and template overhead, resulting in PageSpeed scores of 60-80. Typical Wix sites load in 2-4 seconds. The speed difference matters for: user experience (faster = better), SEO (Google favors fast sites), mobile users (slow sites kill conversions), bounce rates (3+ seconds = 40% bounce). If performance matters for your SEO and user experience, Framer has a clear advantage. If loading speed is less critical than features, Wix's slower performance is the trade-off for functionality."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Switch from Framer to Wix when: you need e-commerce features beyond simple payments, you require multiple apps and integrations, you need specific functionality only available through Wix app marketplace, template lock-in becomes acceptable for the features you gain, you're building a complex business site that needs all-in-one solutions. Switch from Wix to Framer when: design quality becomes critical for your brand, loading speed is hurting your SEO or user experience, you need code export for platform independence, you want modern aesthetics that Wix templates can't achieve, you're tired of paying for multiple apps. The brutal truth: migrations are expensive in both time and money. Choose right the first time. If you're already on one platform and it's working, stay there unless the pain exceeds the migration cost."

        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A local service business needed a website with booking system, email marketing integration, and customer reviews. Same requirements, tested both builders.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Wix route:</strong> Started with Wix AI chat assistant. Generated decent site in 3 minutes. Added booking app from marketplace (Calendly integration, free). Connected email marketing app (MailerLite, free tier). Added review app. All done through Wix App Market—no code required. Total time: 2 hours. Everything worked together seamlessly. Cost: $23/month (Unlimited plan for apps).</p>

          <div class="bg-blue-100 border-l-[4px] border-blue-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-blue-900 font-medium"><strong>The result:</strong> Site launched with full booking system, email capture, automated reviews. Month 1: 1,800 visitors, 47 booking requests, 38 confirmed bookings = $9,500 in revenue. Wix app ecosystem made complex functionality possible without technical skills.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Framer route:</strong> Generated stunning site in 2 minutes with better design. Spent 30 minutes customizing. Then the problem: needed booking system. Framer has no native booking—would need third-party integration or custom development. Email marketing? Would need Zapier ($20/mo) or custom code. Reviews? Would need a separate service or build custom.</p>

          <div class="bg-indigo-100 border-l-[4px] border-indigo-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-indigo-900 font-medium"><strong>The reality:</strong> To match Wix's functionality, Framer would need 4-5 external integrations at $40-80/month total. Plus developer time to set everything up. Framer's beautiful design came with hidden complexity costs.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-violet-100 border-l-[4px] border-violet-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-violet-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Wix's app marketplace (5000+ apps) makes complex functionality accessible to non-technical users. Framer requires technical skills or expensive integrations. For simple sites, Framer wins on design and price. For feature-heavy sites, Wix wins on ease and integration.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>But the designer scenario:</strong> A design portfolio needed visual impact over functionality. Just portfolio, contact form, basic inquiry form.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Framer route:</strong> Built stunning portfolio in 90 minutes. Gorgeous animations, smooth scroll, hover effects on project cards. Loaded in 0.7 seconds. Impressed everyone who visited. Month 1: 600 visitors, 14 project inquiries, 8 converted to clients = $24,000 in projects.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Wix route:</strong> Took 2 hours to find a template that looked good enough. Customization was limited by template structure. Loaded in 2.1 seconds. Month 1: 600 visitors, 11 inquiries, 6 converted = $18,000 in projects. Framer's superior design generated 33% more revenue.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-fuchsia-900 font-medium"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> Framer for design-focused projects where visual impact drives revenue. Wix for feature-heavy sites where app ecosystem saves development time. Framer wins on aesthetics and speed (9.5/10 design vs 8.0/10). Wix wins on features and ecosystem (5000+ apps vs integrations).</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">I've built 40+ sites on both platforms. The pattern is clear: if you need apps and integrations, Wix saves time. If you need design impact, Framer wins every time. Choose based on what drives YOUR revenue.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Is Framer or Wix better for website building?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Framer wins overall (9.0/10 vs 8.2/10) with superior design quality (9.5/10 vs 8.0/10), better flexibility (9.0/10 vs 7.5/10), code export capability, and more affordable pricing starting at $5/month vs $10/month. Wix offers easier usability (8.5/10 vs 8.0/10), massive app marketplace with 5000+ apps, and built-in e-commerce capabilities.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What is the price difference between Framer and Wix?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Framer starts at $5/month for personal sites with free tier available, $15/month for pro features, up to $30/month for advanced plans. Over 3 years, Framer costs $180-1080. Wix starts at $10/month for basic sites, $18/month for unlimited, up to $46/month for e-commerce. Over 3 years, Wix costs $360-1656.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I export code from Framer or Wix?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Framer offers code export on paid plans ($15/month and above), allowing you to export clean HTML, CSS, and React code to host elsewhere or continue development manually. Wix does NOT offer code export - your website stays on Wix's servers permanently and you're locked into their platform.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Which platform has better e-commerce: Framer or Wix?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Wix has significantly better e-commerce capabilities with built-in inventory management, product variants, abandoned cart recovery, gift cards, customer accounts, shipping calculation, and tax automation. Framer offers basic e-commerce features with Gumroad/Lemon Squeezy integrations and simple payment buttons.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Wix has a massive app marketplace with 5000+ apps covering virtually any functionality - booking systems, email marketing, CRM, live chat, analytics, membership areas. Framer has no app marketplace - functionality comes through direct integrations, embed codes, Zapier, and custom React components.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Which platform loads faster: Framer or Wix?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Framer sites typically load significantly faster with PageSpeed scores of 90-100 and load times of 0.5-1.5 seconds. Wix sites often have heavier code with PageSpeed scores of 60-80 and load times of 2-4 seconds. If performance matters for SEO and user experience, Framer has a clear advantage.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">When should I switch from Framer to Wix or vice versa?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Switch from Framer to Wix when you need e-commerce beyond simple payments, require multiple apps and integrations, or need specific functionality from Wix app marketplace. Switch from Wix to Framer when design quality becomes critical, loading speed hurts SEO, you need code export, or want modern aesthetics Wix templates can't achieve.</p>
