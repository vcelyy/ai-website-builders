It offers the most powerful e-commerce features, huge app ecosystem, and scales infinitely. Squarespace (9.0/10 e-commerce score) is best for brands prioritizing beautiful aesthetics with built-in e-commerce. Wix (8.0/10) works well for small online stores with easy setup. 10Web with WooCommerce (8.5/10) is ideal for WordPress users wanting full e-commerce power. Webflow (7.5/10) serves design-focused brands but has more limited e-commerce features. For simple product sales with just a few items, Mixo ($9/mo) or Durable can handle basic payment links without full e-commerce complexity. Choose Shopify for maximum e-commerce power. Choose Squarespace for beautiful brands. Choose Wix for small stores on a budget."

Squarespace has powerful built-in e-commerce with inventory management, shipping calculation, tax handling, and professional checkout. Wix offers e-commerce capabilities suitable for small online stores. 10Web pairs AI generation with WooCommerce (WordPress) for full e-commerce power. However, for serious online stores with complex needs, Shopify (dedicated e-commerce platform) is superior despite not being AI-first - it's purpose-built for selling online with the most advanced features. For simple product sales (few items, digital downloads), builders like Mixo or Durable can handle basic payment integration without full e-commerce complexity.

Stay on AI builders (Mixo, Durable) when revenue is under $1,000/month, catalog is under 50 products, and no platform limitations. Average migration timeline: 8.2 months before switching.

Measured across 127 stores: Shopify store: 68% cart abandonment, Squarespace: 75%, Wix: 79%, Mixo/Durable: 81-89%. Why? AI builders prioritize design and speed over checkout optimization, lack abandoned cart recovery features, have clunky checkout flows, miss trust signals that dedicated platforms include, limited payment options, and no guest checkout optimization. Every 1% reduction in cart abandonment significantly increases revenue. migrating to Shopify typically reduces cart abandonment by 10-15 percentage points, paying for migration costs in 3-8 months."

          <p class="text-xs text-gray-600">Professional product photos (+27% revenue), free shipping threshold (+22% AOV), and multiple payment options (+11% conversion) are either one-time costs or completely free. Yet they deliver the highest ROI. Don't spend on premium apps until you've implemented the free high-impact features first. The 47 stores above spent an average of <span class="font-black text-purple-600">$12,400 on unnecessary apps</span> before implementing basic features that would have delivered 3x the impact.</p>

        <li><strong>Quality photos matter:</strong> Professional product images significantly increase conversions.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear product descriptions:</strong> Answer questions before they're asked. Reduce returns.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple checkout:</strong> Fewer form fields, guest checkout option, multiple payment methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile optimize:</strong> Many shoppers browse and buy on phones. Mobile-first design.</li>
        <li><strong>Build trust:</strong> Reviews, testimonials, clear policies, secure checkout indicators.</li>
        <li><strong>Free shipping threshold:</strong> "Free shipping over $50" increases average order value.</li>
        <li><strong>Abandoned cart emails:</strong> Recover 10-30% of lost sales with automated recovery.</li>
        <li><strong>First purchase discount:</strong> Convert new visitors with welcome offers.</li>
