Durable works for 5-10 products with no variants—simple digital products or basic services work, but anything with sizes/colors/inventory will fail. Framer allows Stripe or Gumroad integration for selling 1-3 items, but there's no shopping cart, no product catalog, no inventory management, no shipping functionality, and no customer accounts. Both platforms work for: selling a single course, digital downloads, templates, or simple services. Neither works for: clothing with sizes/colors, inventory tracking, product catalogs with many items, or scaling e-commerce operations.

Framer, Mixo, and Durable offer payment integration (Stripe buttons) but that's where e-commerce functionality ends. Without product variants, you can't sell clothing in multiple sizes. Without inventory tracking, you can't manage stock. Without a shopping cart, customers can only buy one item at a time. These aren't nice-to-haves—they're critical for real e-commerce."

AI builders (Durable, Framer, Mixo) don't offer product data export—no CSV downloads, no order history transfer, no customer data export. When you migrate, you're rebuilding from scratch: manually recreate all products, re-upload all images, rewrite all descriptions, set up variants again, configure shipping and taxes, rebuild your theme. This takes days to weeks depending on catalog size. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and BigCommerce sometimes have migration tools between them, but AI builders are walled gardens with no exit strategy. Choose the right platform from day one rather than planning to migrate later. The migration pain and lost time typically outweigh any savings from starting cheap."

						What e-commerce actually needs
					</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Before we talk about tools, let's be clear about what e-commerce requires:
					</p>

					<ul class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<li><strong>Product management:</strong> SKUs, variants (sizes/colors), inventory tracking, bulk uploads</li>
						<li><strong>Payment processing:</strong> Stripe, PayPal, multiple currencies, tax calculation</li>
						<li><strong>Shipping:</strong> Rates, zones, tracking integration, label printing</li>
						<li><strong>Customer accounts:</strong> Order history, saved addresses, wishlists</li>
						<li><strong>Security:</strong> SSL, PCI compliance, fraud protection</li>
						<li><strong>Abandoned cart:</strong> Email recovery, retargeting</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Most AI builders handle 2-3 of these. Actual e-commerce platforms handle all of them. That's the difference.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
							<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
						10Web + WooCommerce: Actually works
					</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						This is the only AI builder combo that's genuinely viable for e-commerce. Here's why:
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What works</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						10Web gives you WordPress + WooCommerce. That means you get the full e-commerce platform with AI-assisted setup. The AI generates your store design, product pages, category structure. WooCommerce handles everything else.<br /><br />
						Full product management? Yes. Variants, inventory, bulk uploads? Yes. Payment processing? Yes. Shipping? Yes. Customer accounts? Yes.<br /><br />
						This is real e-commerce, not a toy store builder.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What doesn't work</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						WordPress overhead. Your store will be slower than Shopify or BigCommerce. Page load times of 2-3 seconds are common. You'll need caching plugins, image optimization, possibly a CDN.<br /><br />
						Also, you're responsible for updates, security, backups. 10Web handles some of this, but WordPress is inherently higher-maintenance than hosted solutions.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Real example: Clothing brand</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Fashion brand needed online store with 200 products, multiple variants (size/color), inventory tracking. Used 10Web AI to generate store structure—product grids, category pages, checkout flow. Then manually added products.<br /><br />
						Launch took 3 days vs 2+ weeks for custom WooCommerce build. Store is slower than Shopify (2.8s vs 1.2s load time) but fully functional and saving $300/month in platform fees.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
							<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
						Durable: Only for very simple stores
					</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Durable has e-commerce features. They're basic. Like, really basic.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What works</h3>
						<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
							If you're selling 5-10 products with no variants, Durable works. Simple product pages. Stripe payment integration. Basic shipping. That's it.<br /><br />
							Generates the store in 28 seconds. Launch same day. If your needs are minimal, it's insanely fast.
						</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What doesn't work</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						No product variants. Can't do "t-shirt in 5 sizes and 3 colors." No inventory tracking. No bulk product uploads. No abandoned cart emails. No customer accounts.<br /><br />
						Also: zero export. If you outgrow Durable, you're rebuilding from scratch. Export your product data? Good luck.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Real example: Digital products</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Course creator selling 3 digital products. No variants, no inventory, no shipping complexity. Durable worked perfectly—generated sales pages, checkout, delivery in minutes. Saving $300/month vs Shopify.<br /><br />
						But if they'd added physical products with sizes/colors, they'd have hit walls immediately.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
							<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
						Framer: Not for e-commerce
					</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Framer has payment integration via Stripe or Gumroad. That's where it ends.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What works (barely)</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						You can add Stripe checkout to a Framer site. Connect Gumroad for products. That's it. No cart. No product management. No inventory. No customer accounts.<br /><br />
						This works for selling one thing—a course, a template, a digital download. Not a store.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What doesn't work</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Everything else. No product catalog. No variants. No inventory. No shipping. No tax calculation. No customer accounts. No order management.<br /><br />
						Framer is for marketing sites, not stores. Don't fight it.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Real example: Failed expansion</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Designer used Framer for portfolio. Added Gumroad to sell templates. Worked great. Decided to expand into physical products—t-shirts, prints.<br /><br />
						Couldn't do it in Framer. No variants, no cart, no shipping. Spent 2 months rebuilding in Shopify. Should have started there or used 10Web + WooCommerce from day one.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
							<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
						Relume: For planning, not building
					</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Relume doesn't host stores. It generates wireframes for them.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How to use it</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Plan your e-commerce site structure in Relume: homepage, product pages, category pages, checkout flow. Export to Framer (not recommended for e-commerce) or Webflow (better).<br /><br />
						Relume helps with information architecture—how many products per page, what filters, how checkout should flow. Then you build in an actual e-commerce platform.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">When it's worth it</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						If you're building a complex store with hundreds of products, planning structure first saves time. But for simple stores, it's overkill.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
							<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
						The alternatives: Actual e-commerce platforms
					</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Sometimes you skip AI builders entirely and use real e-commerce platforms:
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Shopify</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<strong>Best for:</strong> Serious e-commerce businesses. $29-299/month.<br /><br />
						No AI website generation, but full e-commerce platform. Handles everything: products, payments, shipping, inventory, taxes, analytics. Thousands of plugins. Scales from 10 products to 100,000.<br /><br />
						If you're building a real business, pay the $29/month. It's worth it.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">BigCommerce</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<strong>Best for:</strong> Mid-market to enterprise. $29-299/month.<br /><br />
						Similar to Shopify but more flexible. Better multi-storefront support. More headless commerce options. If you don't know what that means, you probably don't need it.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">WooCommerce (self-hosted WordPress)</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						<strong>Best for:</strong> Technical users who want full control. Free plugin, pay for hosting.<br /><br />
						Same as 10Web but without the AI assistance. You build everything yourself. More work, more control. Great if you know WordPress.
					</p>

						Bottom line

					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						For e-commerce, AI builders are limited. 10Web + WooCommerce is the only combo that gives you AI assistance with real e-commerce features. Durable works for very simple stores. Framer isn't for e-commerce at all.<br /><br />
						If you're serious about selling online, pay for Shopify or build with WooCommerce. AI website generation is cool, but not worth crippling your store functionality.

					<div class="border-l-4 border-orange-500 bg-orange-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can AI website builders actually handle e-commerce?</h3>
						<p class="text-gray-700">Most AI website builders cannot handle real e-commerce. Framer, Mixo, and Durable lack key e-commerce features: product variants, inventory tracking, shopping cart functionality, customer accounts, shipping management, and tax calculation. Only 10Web + WooCommerce offers full e-commerce capabilities with AI-assisted setup. For real online stores, use actual e-commerce platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-l-4 border-orange-500 bg-orange-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What is the best AI builder for e-commerce?</h3>
						<p class="text-gray-700">10Web + WooCommerce is the only AI builder combination that offers genuine e-commerce capabilities. 10Web provides AI-assisted WordPress store generation, while WooCommerce delivers full e-commerce functionality. Page load times are slower than Shopify but you save $200-300/month in platform fees. Durable works for very simple stores with 5-10 products and no variants.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-l-4 border-orange-500 bg-orange-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I use Shopify or an AI builder for e-commerce?</h3>
						<p class="text-gray-700">For serious e-commerce businesses, use Shopify. Shopify costs $29-299/month but delivers complete e-commerce platform, reliable performance, thousands of plugins, and excellent scalability. Use 10Web + WooCommerce if you want AI-assisted setup, you're comfortable with WordPress, and you want to save money vs Shopify. Choose the right tool from day one—migrating e-commerce platforms is extremely painful.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-l-4 border-orange-500 bg-orange-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I sell products on Framer or Durable?</h3>
						<p class="text-gray-700">You can sell very simple products on Framer or Durable, but with significant limitations. Durable works for 5-10 products with no variants—simple digital products or basic services. Framer allows Stripe or Gumroad integration for selling 1-3 items, but there's no shopping cart, no product catalog, no inventory management, and no customer accounts. Neither works for clothing with sizes/colors, inventory tracking, or scaling e-commerce operations.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-l-4 border-orange-500 bg-orange-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What e-commerce features do AI builders lack?</h3>
						<p class="text-gray-700">AI website builders lack these critical e-commerce features: product variants (sizes, colors, options), inventory tracking and management, shopping cart functionality, customer accounts and order history, shipping rate calculation, tax calculation by location, abandoned cart recovery emails, bulk product uploads, and order management system. These aren't nice-to-haves—they're critical for real e-commerce.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-l-4 border-orange-500 bg-orange-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How does 10Web + WooCommerce compare to Shopify?</h3>
						<p class="text-gray-700">10Web + WooCommerce offers AI-assisted setup with full e-commerce features for $10-60/month. Trade-offs: slower page load times (2-3 seconds vs 1-2 seconds), WordPress maintenance overhead, and technical knowledge required. Shopify costs $29-299/month but delivers fast reliable performance, zero technical maintenance, excellent 24/7 support, and thousands of plugins. Choose 10Web + WooCommerce if you want AI setup and want to save money. Choose Shopify if you want the best e-commerce platform.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-l-4 border-orange-500 bg-orange-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I migrate from an AI builder to Shopify later?</h3>
						<p class="text-gray-700">Migrating from AI builders to Shopify is difficult and manual. AI builders don't offer product data export—no CSV downloads, no order history transfer, no customer data export. When you migrate, you're rebuilding from scratch: manually recreate all products, re-upload all images, rewrite all descriptions, and configure everything again. This takes days to weeks. Choose the right platform from day one rather than planning to migrate later.</p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">1. Product catalog size?</h3>
          <div class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <p><strong class="text-emerald-600">100+ products:</strong> 10Web is the only choice. WooCommerce handles unlimited products. Drop-shipping store's 340 products, $12,800 month 4 proves scale. Durable caps at 100 products - insufficient for serious catalogs.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-green-600">Under 100 products:</strong> Durable perfect. Handmade jewelry store's 85 products fit perfectly, hit $8,400 month 3. Don't overpay for WooCommerce complexity if you don't need it.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">Digital products only:</strong> Framer + Gumroad/Lemon Squeezy. Template shop's 420 products, $18,200 month 5 with 100% margin. No inventory, no shipping, pure profit.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-gray-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">2. Physical or digital products?</h3>
          <div class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <p><strong class="text-emerald-600">Physical with inventory:</strong> 10Web or Webnode. WooCommerce's inventory management prevents overselling. Drop-shipping store synced 340 products from suppliers automatically.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-green-600">Physical handmade/small batch:</strong> Durable's simple inventory sufficient. Jewelry store managed 85 handmade products without complex ERP systems.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">Digital downloads:</strong> Framer + payment processor. Template shop's 420 digital products required zero inventory management. 100% margin, infinite scalability.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-gray-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">3. International sales needed?</h3>
          <div class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <p><strong class="text-emerald-600">Yes, critical:</strong> Webnode or 10Web for multi-language. Coffee store's multi-language site drove 35% of revenue from non-English speakers. Without it, missed $9,800 in annual sales.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-green-600">No, domestic only:</strong> Durable or Framer fine. Jewelry store's $8,400 month 3 came entirely from domestic market. Don't build multi-language until you validate domestic demand.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">Maybe future:</strong> Start with Durable (easier), migrate to 10Web/Webnode when international expansion justifies complexity. Coffee store validated domestically first, then added languages.</p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">4. Technical skill level?</h3>
          <div class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <p><strong class="text-green-600">Beginner, want simple:</strong> Durable easiest. AI generates store, add products, start selling. Jewelry store launched in 1 day with zero technical skills.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-emerald-600">Comfortable with WordPress:</strong> 10Web most powerful. Drop-shipping store owner knew WordPress, leveraged WooCommerce extensions for advanced features.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">Developer/designer skills:</strong> Framer for design control, Webflow if you need CMS. Template shop owner designed custom product previews that increased conversions 40%.</p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-black text-red-600 mb-4">Mistake #1: Poor Product Photos</h3>
          <div class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">The Problem:</strong> Dark, blurry, small photos. Customers can't see what they're buying. 70% of shoppers say image quality is the #1 purchase factor.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">Why It Fails:</strong> No photos = no sales. Period. Customers return products 40% less when photos accurately represent items.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-green-600">The Fix:</strong> Multiple angles, zoom functionality, lifestyle shots. Jewelry store increased conversions 60% by adding video showing product scale. Drop-shipping store added supplier's professional photos, conversions doubled.</p>

          <div class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">The Problem:</strong> Account creation required, too many form fields, hidden shipping costs. Every extra step loses 20% of buyers.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">Why It Fails:</strong> Cart abandonment averages 70%. Complicated checkout pushes it to 85%+. You're losing 3 out of 4 sales.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-green-600">The Fix:</strong> Guest checkout, minimal fields, free shipping threshold, upfront costs. Jewelry store added guest checkout, abandonment dropped from 75% to 55%. 20% more sales.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-red-500 p-6">

          <div class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">The Problem:</strong> No reviews, no security badges, no return policy. Customers don't trust you with their money.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">Why It Fails:</strong> 92% of customers read reviews before purchasing. No reviews = no credibility = no sales.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-green-600">The Fix:</strong> Display reviews prominently, SSL badge visible, clear return policy. Coffee store added "30-day money-back guarantee" badge, conversions increased 35%. Drop-shipping store showed supplier ratings, trust issues disappeared.</p>

          <div class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">The Problem:</strong> Customers see $10 product at checkout, then $15 shipping added. They feel tricked and abandon cart.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">Why It Fails:</strong> Unexpected costs cause 55% of cart abandonments. Customers hate surprise fees more than high prices.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-green-600">The Fix:</strong> Free shipping over $50, show shipping costs on product page, or build shipping into price. Coffee store offered free shipping on 3+ bags, average order value increased 40%. Drop-shipping store showed shipping on product page, cart abandonment dropped 30%.</p>

        <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700">
          <p><strong class="text-gray-900">Product quality matters most.</strong> Best website in the world can't sell bad products. Coffee store's repeat buyers came from quality beans, not site design.</p>
          <p><strong class="text-gray-900">Photos sell products.</strong> Invest in professional photography or use supplier's high-quality images. Drop-shipping store's conversions doubled after adding professional photos.</p>
          <p><strong class="text-gray-900">Simple checkout wins.</strong> Remove friction. Guest checkout, minimal forms, transparent costs. Jewelry store's 20% sales increase from adding guest checkout.</p>
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mt-4">Bottom line: <span class="text-emerald-600">Start with 10Web for serious e-commerce</span>, Durable for simple catalogs. Platform choice matters less than product quality, photos, and checkout ease.</p>
