            GoDaddy AI is the definition of "good enough."
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            It works. It generates sites. It integrates with your GoDaddy domain. Nothing is broken.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            But nothing is <em>great</em> either.

              After 15 hours of testing, I couldn't recall a single memorable thing about GoDaddy AI.

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">
              Not one feature that stood out. Not one moment where I thought "wow, that's clever."

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>That's the trap.</strong>
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            If you're already paying GoDaddy for hosting, and you need a basic site, and you don't want to learn a new tool... GoDaddy AI is convenient.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            You'll get a site that looks like it was built in 2018. Your PageSpeed scores will be mediocre (50-65/100). Your customization options will be limited.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            But it'll work.

            <p class="text-sm text-yellow-900 mt-2">
              Your website is often the first impression customers get. "Good enough" means "forgettable."
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm text-yellow-900 mt-2">
              If you care about standing out? Use Framer, Squarespace, or even Wix. If you just need <em>something</em> up? GoDaddy will do.

            I rated GoDaddy AI 7.2/10. Not because it's terrible, but because it's aggressively average in a world with better options.
