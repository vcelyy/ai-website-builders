									<p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-1">AI builders cost $9-25/month. Custom dev costs $5,000 upfront. Sounds like AI wins. But after 3 years, you've paid $900 for the AI builder and still don't own anything. Custom dev: you own it day one. The math only works if your project is temporary or you absolutely can't afford upfront.</p>

									<p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-1">You describe "modern coffee shop site." AI picks from 50 coffee shop templates. That's not AI generation—that's template selection with extra steps. You're not getting something unique; you're getting a pre-made design with AI-written copy.</p>

									<p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-1">Framer exports React code. Great, except you need a React developer to deploy it. Mixo exports a zip file of HTML/CSS that's impossible to maintain. "Code export" markets to developers, but the only people using AI builders are non-developers. Catch-22.</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The startup that outgrew Framer in 6 months</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Tech startup used Framer for their initial landing page. Worked great at first. Then they needed: customer dashboards, admin panels, API documentation, interactive pricing calculators. Framer couldn\'t do any of it. Spent 3 months rebuilding in Next.js. Should have started with Next.js—they had developers and funding, but chose the "fast" option and paid for it later.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The e-commerce brand that chose Durable</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Fashion brand needed online store. Chose Durable for speed (28 second generation). Realized too late: no product variants (no sizes/colors), no inventory management, basic payment processing only. Rebuilt in 10Web with WooCommerce 3 months later. Lost sales during transition. Should have assessed e-commerce requirements upfront—any basic research would have shown Durable wasn\'t viable.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The agency that built client sites on proprietary platforms</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						Marketing agency built client sites on Framer and Durable because it was fast. Clients loved the speed. Six months later, clients wanted to move sites in-house or switch agencies. Couldn't—locked into proprietary platforms. Agency had to rebuild everything from scratch. Lost clients, lost money, damaged reputation. Should have used portable platforms from day one.
					</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>The hybrid approach (best of both worlds)</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						You don\'t have to choose exclusively between AI builders and traditional development. Smart teams use both:
					</p>

					<div class="my-8 p-6 bg-gray-100 border-[3px] border-gray-300 border-[3px]">
						<ol class="text-sm text-gray-600 space-y-3 list-decimal list-inside">
							<li><strong>Phase 1 - MVP:</strong> Use AI builders to launch fast (Framer for marketing, 10Web for e-commerce)</li>
							<li><strong>Phase 2 - Validate:</strong> Get users, test assumptions, see what actually matters</li>
							<li><strong>Phase 3 - Decide:</strong> If product works, rebuild custom for scale. If not, you lost little.</li>
						</ol>
						<p class="text-xs text-gray-600 mt-4 pt-4 border-t border-gray-300">
							<strong>This is how smart startups work:</strong> Ship fast with AI tools, then rebuild properly if validation succeeds. You spend time on what works, not building castles in the air.

						<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Bottom line</h2>
					<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
						AI website builders are tools, not universal solutions. They\'re incredible for: landing pages, portfolios, simple sites, MVPs, speed-to-market.<br /><br />
						They\'re wrong for: complex apps, long-term business sites, granular SEO control, highly regulated industries, or when you have development resources and time.<br /><br />
						The mistake isn\'t using AI builders—it\'s using them for everything. Know when they fit. Know when they don\'t. Choose accordingly.
