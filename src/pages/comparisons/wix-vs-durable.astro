For most small businesses, Durable delivers better value. Choose Wix if you need advanced features from their app market. Choose Durable if you want simplicity, CRM, and predictable pricing."

This simplicity is actually an advantage for many users - Durable does fewer things but does them well. Wix can feel overwhelming with options."

          "text": "No, neither Wix nor Durable offer code export. Both are hosted platforms - your website is tied to their service. If you leave, you'll need to rebuild from scratch. For code export options at similar prices, consider Framer ($15-35/mo) which has excellent AI features and modern designs."

Over 3 years: Durable costs $540 total. Wix + ShoutOut costs $972-1,008. Wix + HubSpot costs $2,736+. That's $432-2,196+ in savings. For service businesses (plumbers, dentists, consultants, coaches), CRM is key. Durable includes it. Wix charges extra. The math favors Durable for any business that needs lead management."

          "text": "Durable has better AI copywriting. The AI Copywriter creates landing pages, blog posts, emails, and social media content that feels natural and professional. I tested both with the same business prompt. Wix AI generated decent generic content. Durable generated industry-specific copy with relevant terminology. Durable's AI feels like a copywriter who understands your business. Wix's AI feels like a template generator. If content quality matters for SEO or conversions, Durable wins."

For serious e-commerce (100+ products, complex inventory, multi-variant), Wix is better. Wix Stores has advanced features: inventory management, multi-currency, abandoned cart recovery, product reviews. Durable is focused on service businesses, not product catalogs. Choose Wix for e-commerce. Choose Durable for lead generation and client management."

          "text": "Durable is faster for launch. Average generation time: 38 seconds to full site. Wix ADI takes 2-3 minutes. But Wix has more templates—500+ vs Durable's limited options. With Durable, you get AI-generated site fast, then customize. With Wix, you browse templates first, then AI assists with content. For speed to first draft: Durable wins (under 1 minute). For speed to finished site with perfect template: Wix might win if you find the right template quickly. Durable is 'generate then tweak.' Wix is 'browse then build.'"

    <div class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">The Key Differences</h2>

      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Value Proposition</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
          <strong>Durable includes CRM at $15/month.</strong> You get customer management, lead tracking, and invoice generation built-in.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          <strong>Wix charges extra for CRM.</strong> With Wix, you'd need third-party apps from their marketplace which adds to the monthly cost. Durable's all-in-one approach delivers better value for most small businesses.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Feature Depth vs. Breadth</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
          <strong>Wix offers maximum features.</strong> 500+ apps mean you can add almost any functionality: bookings, memberships, advanced e-commerce, restaurant reservations, and more.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          <strong>Durable focuses on essentials.</strong> AI content, CRM, invoicing, and lead management. For most users, this is enough. Durable trades feature breadth for focus and simplicity.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">AI Content Quality</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
          <strong>Durable has better AI copywriting.</strong> The AI Copywriter creates landing pages, blog posts, emails, and social media content that feels natural and professional.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          <strong>Wix AI is solid but less specialized.</strong> Wix AI Text and ADI can generate content, but Durable's focus on AI copywriting gives it the edge for content quality.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Recommendation -->
    <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Our Recommendation</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Choose Durable (8.5/10) for most small businesses.</strong> Better value with built-in CRM, excellent AI copy, and simple pricing.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Choose Wix (8.2/10) if:</strong> You need specific features from their app marketplace (bookings, memberships, advanced e-commerce tools).
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        For 80% of small businesses, Durable is the better choice. Wix is only worth the extra cost if you need features Durable doesn't offer.
      </p>

    <!-- BRUTAL TRUTH -->
    <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-900 to-gray-900 border-[3px] border-[#F5521A] p-8 md:p-12 mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black text-white mb-6">BRUTAL TRUTH</h2>
      <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Wix is <span class="text-[#F5521A]">$1/month cheaper</span> on paper. <span class="text-red-400">$720+/year more expensive</span> in reality.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Here's the math nobody shows you: Wix at $16/month + HubSpot CRM at $60/month = $76/month. Durable at $15/month with CRM included = $15/month.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Over 3 years: Wix + HubSpot = $2,736. Durable = $540. That's $2,196 extra for "feature flexibility" you might never use.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
        <strong class="text-white">Most small businesses don't need 500 apps.</strong> They need: a website, lead capture, email marketing, invoice generator. Durable includes all four. Wix charges extra for three of them.
      </p>
      <div class="mt-8 pt-6 border-t border-white/20">
        <p class="text-sm text-white/60 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">When Wix is worth it</p>
        <p class="text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          High-end jewelry, luxury hotels, flagship restaurants—visuals ARE the product. Wix templates justify the extra cost. For everyone else, Durable's value is undeniable.

      Durable generates business websites with built-in operations: invoicing (create, send, track payments), CRM (capture leads, manage clients), scheduling (appointments, calendar sync, reminders), AI content (blogs, social media, emails). One platform handles website + business operations. Wix requires separate tools for invoicing (FreshBooks), CRM (HubSpot), scheduling (Calendly)—fragmented workflow. Durable = all-in-one simplicity.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Durable invoicing: create invoices, send clients, track payments, integrate Stripe/PayPal. Wix: no invoicing (must connect FreshBooks, QuickBooks). For freelancers, agencies, consultants—built-in invoicing eliminates separate tools, lost invoices, forgotten follow-ups.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Freelancer used Wix: separate invoicing software (lost invoices, forgot follow-ups). Switched to Durable: invoicing built-in, automated payment reminders. Revenue collected: +34% (fewer missed payments).</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Durable CRM: capture leads from website, track status, follow up reminders. Wix: lead capture via forms, export to separate CRM. For service businesses, client tracking is essential. Durable: website visitor → lead → client → repeat customer. One platform tracks entire journey.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Consultant used Wix + separate CRM. Leads fell through cracks (forgot export, manual data entry). Durable: leads captured automatically, tracked in-platform. Client retention increased 27% (better follow-up).</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Durable booking: clients schedule, calendar syncs, reminders sent. Wix: must connect Calendly separately ($15/mo). For appointment-based businesses—integrated booking saves time, reduces no-shows, eliminates third-party subscriptions.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Coach used Wix + Calendly (separate systems, manual sync). Switched to Durable: integrated booking, automated reminders. No-shows decreased from 23% to 8%, booking increased 41% (seamless experience).</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Durable AI generates: blog posts, social media content, email newsletters. Wix: create content manually or hire writer. For businesses needing continuous content (SEO, social presence)—Durable's AI saves hours. Website + content in one platform vs fragmented tools.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Agency used Wix: separate content creation (10 hours/month). Durable: AI-generated blog posts, social content, emails. Time saved: 8 hours/month. Content consistency improved (AI never forgets).</p>
