          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Dr. Sarah Kim, Beverly Hills facial plastic surgeon. 14 years practice. Specializes in rhinoplasty and facelifts. Basic site: logo, "About" page with bio, 12 before/after photos total (no organization), board certification buried on page 3, generic "Contact" form for consultations, patient testimonials hidden, not mobile-friendly. Monthly consultations: 8. Quarterly revenue: $64,000. Google ranking: page 6 for "Beverly Hills rhinoplasty." Competitors with extensive galleries capturing all inquiries. Dr. Kim thinking: "Patients are referred by other doctors, website doesn't matter." WRONG. 73% of cosmetic surgery patients research online before choosing surgeon.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Chose Webflow for custom gallery layouts. Built: brutal hero with "Beverly Hills Premier Facial Plastic Surgery" messaging, before/after gallery organized by procedure (rhinoplasty, facelift, blepharoplasty, breast augmentation), 200+ patient results with multiple angles (front, side, three-quarter), patient video testimonials prominently, visible board certification (ABPS) on hero and footer, detailed procedure pages with recovery timelines, virtual consultation booking, surgeon bio + training prominently, financing information clearly.

Quarterly revenue: $216,000 (up from $64,000 = 238% increase). Google ranking: page 1 position 3 for "Beverly Hills rhinoplasty." Before/after gallery: patients spend 9.2 minutes browsing (vs 2:41 before), 84% book consultation after viewing results. Board certification visible: patients cite "qualified surgeon" as #1 reason for choosing her. Patient testimonials: "saw real patient stories = felt safe = booked." Video testimonials: patients hear genuine results = trust = book. Recovery timelines: informed patients = serious inquiries = higher conversion. Dr. Kim: "Professional gallery = expert surgeon = trust = book consultation. Before: invisible despite excellent skills. After: patients see results = trust my expertise = book."</p>

          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">How many before/after photos should I display?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">100+ minimum, organized by procedure. Patients want proof of skill. 79% want 50+ results for their specific procedure. Organize by: rhinoplasty, facelift, blepharoplasty, breast augmentation, etc. Multiple angles per patient: front, side, three-quarter view. Consistent lighting: professional quality. Real results: no excessive editing. Gallery = your skill = trust = consultation booking. More photos = more proof = more trust = more bookings. Investment in professional photography returns 10x through increased consultations.</p>

          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I display board certification prominently?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Yes, everywhere. 67% of patients won't book without visible certification. Add "ABPS Board Certified" to hero section, footer, every page. Patients search specifically for board-certified surgeons. Hidden certification = questionable qualifications = skip surgeon. Visible = qualified = safe = choose you. Certification is your primary credential - display it proudly. Your years of training and expertise deserve prominence. Don't hide your biggest trust signal.</p>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-fuchsia-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">Do patient video testimonials really matter?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Yes, significantly. Video testimonials increase bookings 67%. Patients hear genuine emotion, see real results, feel safe. Video = authentic = trustworthy = book. Ask satisfied patients: record 30-60 second videos. Cover: procedure experience, recovery, results happiness. Feature prominently on homepage. Video testimonials = social proof = safe = trust = consultation booking. Static quotes are okay. Video is powerful. Patients see real people, hear genuine stories, trust you with their face.</p>

          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">What procedure information should I include?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Everything patients need to know. Procedure overview, what to expect, anesthesia type, surgery duration, recovery timeline (week 1, week 2, week 4), results timeline (when you'll see final results), potential risks, cost range. Detailed pages = informed patients = serious consultations = higher conversion. 43% more qualified inquiries with detailed info. Informed patients waste less time, book more confidently, have realistic expectations = happier results = more referrals. Hidden details = uninformed inquiries = wasted consultations.</p>

          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">How do I make consultation booking easy?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Online booking form with auto-confirm. Name, email, phone, procedure interest, preferred dates, questions. Auto-confirm receipt immediately. Follow up within 24 hours. 61% abandon if can't book easily. Busy patients want instant scheduling. Consider offering virtual consultations for out-of-town patients (huge opportunity: many patients travel for surgery). Easy = they book immediately = more consultations = more surgeries. "Email us to schedule" = friction = abandonment.</p>

          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">Is mobile optimization important for cosmetic surgery websites?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Critical. 79% of patients research on phones. Patients browse privately (don't want coworkers knowing), research during lunch, compare surgeons anywhere. Non-responsive gallery = can't see results = skip this surgeon. 67% leave immediately if broken on mobile. Ensure: gallery swipeable, photos load fast, booking works on phone, click-to-call buttons. Mobile = they browse anywhere = more consultations = more surgeries. Your mobile site IS your practice for most patients.</p>

          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">Which platform for high-volume practices (500+ photos)?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Webflow for gallery scalability. Custom gallery handles 500+ photos efficiently. Organize by procedure, angle, patient type. Filter by rhinoplasty, facelift, breast, body. Multiple views per patient. Fast updates when new results available. Squarespace works for 20-99 photos but template constraints limit high-volume management. Format is photo-first but lacks procedure organization. For 500+ photos: Webflow delivers custom control at scale. Your gallery grows with your practice. Webflow scales. Others don't.</p>
