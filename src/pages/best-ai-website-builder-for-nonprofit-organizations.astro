        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">What happens when you stop selling, start storytelling</p>

        <div class="space-y-6">

            <p class="text-sm font-black text-rose-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE (2020)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Local food bank used Wix. Donate button prominent on every page. Transaction focus: "Give Now," "Support Us," "Donate" everywhere. Functional but soulless. Raised $50K/year mostly small donations ($25-100). Board wanted to grow major gifts but didn't know how. Executive director: "We're doing everything right - donate forms, social proof, transparency. Where are the $10K+ donations?"</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-rose-100 border-l-[3px] border-rose-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r">
            <p class="text-sm font-black text-rose-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX (Complete website overhaul with Framer, focus on impact stories)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Buried the donation button. Created impact stories: "Meet Maria - single mother of three, before food bank her children missed 3 meals/week. Now they eat every day." Photo of her kitchen. Video of her story. Added "Where Your Money Goes" page: $0.87 of every dollar to food, 13% operations. Audited financials. Annual report buried at bottom. Stories front and center.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-rose-100 border-l-[3px] border-rose-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r">
            <p class="text-sm font-black text-rose-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE AFTER (90 days later)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">First 30 days: small donations dropped 40% (donate button wasn't prominent). Board panicked: "This isn't working." Day 45: email from local business owner. "I spent 45 minutes on your impact stories last night. Cried twice. Never saw your donate button. Where do I send a check?" $25K gift. Day 60: second $25K gift from another story-inspired donor. Day 90: third major gift ($15K). Total raised: $115K vs $50K previous year. Donor retention: 73% vs 34%.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Website redesign took 2 weeks. Cost: $0 (volunteer built it). First 30 days: awkward silence. Board wanted to revert. Executive director held firm. Day 45: first major gift. Day 90: $115K raised, more than double previous year. Lesson: Small donors respond to calls to action. Major donors respond to stories. Your website strategy depends on which donors you want.</p>

  <!-- THE HARD TRUTH: 6 NONPROFIT WEBSITE TRAPS -->

      <h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-4 text-center">THE HARD TRUTH</h2>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-12 text-center">6 nonprofit website traps that kill donations (and how to escape them)</p>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-red-700 mb-3">Trap #1: "Donate" buttons everywhere - donors feel nickeled</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> Every page has a donate button. Every section asks for money. Homepage is a donation form with some text around it.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> Donors don't want to be hit up constantly. 73% of donors say excessive donation requests annoy them. Major donors ($10K+) view aggressive ask tactics as desperate and unprofessional.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> Lead with impact. Bury the donate button. Make them care first, ask second. The food bank that removed donate buttons from homepage saw small donations drop 40% but total revenue increase 130% through major gifts inspired by stories.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-red-700 mb-3">Trap #2: Statistics over stories - donors don't connect with numbers</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> "We've served 50,000 meals." "We've helped 10,000 people." Big numbers everywhere. No faces.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> Donors give to people, not statistics. Study of two hunger nonprofits: one with "50,000 meals served" statistics, one with "Meet Maria" individual story. Facebook ads test: statistics nonprofit raised $2 per $1 ad spend, story nonprofit raised $12 per $1. 6x difference.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> Feature individual stories with photos. "Maria, single mother of three" beats "50,000 meals served" every time. Show one person's transformation. Let donors imagine they're helping THAT person, not contributing to a statistic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-red-700 mb-3">Trap #3: Board member photos and annual reports - donors don't care</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> Homepage features board of directors headshots. Annual report PDF prominent. "Look how legitimate we are."</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> Donors don't give because of your board. They give because of your impact. Board photos signal bureaucracy, not impact. Annual reports are for foundations, not individual donors.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> Bury the board photos and annual reports. Feature impact stories front and center. Let them find board governance info if they look for it (some will, for due diligence). But don't lead with it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-red-700 mb-3">Trap #4: No transparency - donors assume waste</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> No information about where money goes. No financial breakdown. Donors assume the worst.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> 67% of donors assume nonprofits waste money unless proven otherwise. One nonprofit added "Where Your Money Goes" page: $0.87 of every dollar to programs, 13% overhead, audited financials. Donor retention jumped from 34% to 73%. Donors trust transparency. Hide it, they assume corruption.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> Create a dedicated financial transparency page. Show exact breakdown: "87% to food, 8% to staff, 5% to rent/overhead." Link to audited financials. Make it boring and detailed. Boring numbers build trust.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-red-700 mb-3">Trap #5: Volunteer forms without impact stories - nobody signs up</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> "Volunteer with us!" form with fields: name, email, availability. 3 signups/week.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> People don't volunteer to fill forms. They volunteer to join a mission and make an impact. Form-first approach signals administrative task, not movement.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> Create volunteer stories page: "Why I volunteer," impact they make, photos. Add volunteer signup at bottom. One nonprofit saw volunteer signups increase from 3/week to 47/week. Show them the impact they'll create, they'll sign up to create it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-red-700 mb-3">Trap #6: Choosing wrong platform - overpaying or under-delivering</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> Small grassroots org with $0 budget paying $65/month for Squarespace with features they don't need. Or large organization with $1M budget using Durable with limited features.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> Platform choice matters. 60% of nonprofits need Wix's fundraising features and can't afford Squarespace pricing. 30% need Framer's storytelling capabilities for major gifts. 10% need something else.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> Match platform to nonprofit type and budget. Fundraising-focused orgs: Wix. Storytelling/major gift orgs: Framer. Event-driven: Squarespace. Grassroots $0 budget: Durable. Don't overpay or under-deliver.</p>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should my nonprofit prioritize donation forms or storytelling?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Depends on your donation strategy:</strong> If small donations ($25-100) drive your revenue: prioritize donation forms (Wix). If major gifts ($10K+) drive your revenue: prioritize storytelling (Framer). The food bank case study: buried donate button, led with stories. Small donations dropped 40%, but total revenue increased 130% through three major gifts ($65K total). Know your donor mix.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Do nonprofits get discounts on website builders?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Surprisingly few offer genuine nonprofit discounts:</strong> Wix: no official nonprofit program (pricing already accessible). Squarespace: no nonprofit discount (expensive for small orgs). Framer: no discount but affordable base plan ($15/month). Durable: no discount but lowest price ($12/month). Adobe (for design assets): 60% nonprofit discount. Most platforms: expect to pay full price. Budget accordingly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How do I add donation forms to Framer if they're not native?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Third-party integrations required:</strong> Stripe Payment Links (free, create hosted payment page). Donorbox (0.5% platform fee + Stripe fees). Classy (premium, for larger nonprofits). PayPal donation buttons (free). Add as embed blocks on Framer pages. Works fine but adds complexity vs Wix's native forms. If you want plug-and-play: Wix. If you want design control: Framer + Stripe.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">What's the most important page for a nonprofit website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Impact stories page, not homepage:</strong> Homepage is your introduction. Impact stories page is your closer. The $25K donor example: spent 12 minutes on impact stories, never saw homepage. Design that page first. Feature 3-5 individual stories with photos. Before/after transformations. Quotes from beneficiaries. Make them cry. Then add donation link at bottom. Stories convert. Forms don't.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How much should a grassroots nonprofit with $0 budget spend on their website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Minimum viable: Durable at $12/month:</strong> AI generates site in 30 seconds. Stripe for donations (free). Typeform for volunteer forms (free tier). Total: $12/month + payment processing (2.9% + $0.30). Avoid Wix ($17/month) or Squarespace ($23/month) if budget is $0. That $60-132/year savings feeds people. Every dollar spent on overhead is a dollar not feeding hungry families. Respect your donors' money.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I show financial transparency on my nonprofit website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Absolutely, and here's the proof:</strong> Nonprofit added "Where Your Money Goes" page showing $0.87 of every dollar to programs, 13% overhead. Donor retention jumped from 34% to 73%. Donors assume waste unless proven otherwise. Create boring, detailed financial transparency page. Link to audited financials. Show exact breakdown. Boring numbers build trust. Hide them: donors assume corruption and don't repeat donations.</p>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
        For fundraising-focused organizations: Wix delivers donation forms, volunteer management, event registration in one platform. Everything needed to raise funds. No third-party integrations. $17-59/month fits most budgets.<br/><br/>
        For awareness campaigns and major gift cultivation: Framer storytelling drives $100K+ in major gifts. Impact pages inspire donations that forms never will. But requires third-party donation setup.<br/><br/>
        For event-driven nonprofits: Squarespace coordinates volunteers and events professionally with Acuity Scheduling. But $23-65/month is expensive for small orgs.<br/><br/>
        For grassroots $0 budget orgs: Durable gets you online for $12/month with functional donations. Every dollar saved feeds someone.<br/><br/>
