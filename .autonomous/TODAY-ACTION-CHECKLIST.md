After 6 weeks of testing AI website builders, here are the 5 that actually work
```

**Step 3:** Enter this EXACT content:
```
I spent 127 hours testing 23 AI website builders. Here's what I learned:

THE REALITY:
Most "AI" builders are just template remixers. Only 5 are worth using.

THE WINNERS (with scores):
1. Framer (9.3/10) - Stunning design, but locks you in
2. 10Web (8.8/10) - Best WordPress AI integration
3. Webflow (8.7/10) - Powerful, exportable code
4. Durable (8.5/10) - 30 seconds to live site
5. Squarespace (8.2/10) - Best for e-commerce

THE WORST:
Wix ADI (3.2/10) - Kept breaking, couldn't export, wasted 6 hours

THE TRUTH ABOUT AI BUILDERS:
- "AI-generated" usually means "template-based"
- Most lock you into their hosting
- Export limitations are common
- Design quality varies massively

I built a review site with full breakdowns:
