					<p class="text-sm">
						<strong>Quick reality check:</strong> I built sites for a restaurant, a plumber, a dentist, and a coffee shop. They all asked the same questions: "Can I update the hours myself?" "Will this work on my phone?" "How much is this going to cost me?" They don't care about scroll animations. They care if customers can find them.
					</p>

					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>What local businesses actually care about</h2>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">"Can I update the hours myself?"</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					This is the number one question I got from local business owners. They change hours seasonally, for holidays, randomly. They don't want to email you every time. They want to click "edit" and change "9AM-5PM" to "10AM-4PM." Durable wins here—it's simple. Framer? 10-minute tutorial. 10Web? Depends on their WordPress familiarity.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">"Will this work on my phone?"</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Local business owners check their own sites on their phones. Customers look them up on phones. If your site isn't mobile-perfect, it's broken. All four tools handle mobile decently, but Durable's templates are clearly mobile-first. Framer looks amazing on mobile but it's over-engineered for a plumber's website.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">"How much is this going to cost me?"</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					They care about monthly costs. They care about hosting. They care about hidden fees. Durable is straightforward pricing—$12/month. Framer adds up fast—$15-25/month for anything usable. 10Web is WordPress so you're paying for hosting somewhere. Be transparent about costs or they'll feel burned.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">"Can people call me from the site?"</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Click-to-call phone numbers are table stakes. All four tools do this. But test it—actually click the phone number on mobile and make sure it dials. You'd be surprised how often it breaks. All four tools passed this test, but it's worth checking.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>What actually matters (and what doesn't)</h2>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Google Maps integration</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					When someone searches "pizza near me," you want to show up. Embedding a functional Google Map helps. All tools can do this, but test that the address actually links correctly. I've seen broken map links on supposedly "professional" sites.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Loading speed on mobile data</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					People look up local businesses on 4G in parking lots. If your site takes 5 seconds to load, they bounced. In our tests: Durable loaded fastest at 0.8s. Framer was 0.9s. 10Web was slowest at 2.3s because of WordPress overhead. That might not sound like much, but it matters when someone's impatient and hungry.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Fancy animations don't matter</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Your local coffee shop doesn't need scroll animations or micro-interactions. They need their address visible. Framer is beautiful here but it's wasted effort. Durable's templates are boring but they work. For a plumber who just wants the phone to ring, boring is fine.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Blog functionality doesn't matter</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Most local businesses will never publish a blog post. Don't pay for features they won't use. Durable doesn't even have a blog—that's fine for a dentist office. They don't need it. 10Web has full blogging capabilities that will sit unused.
