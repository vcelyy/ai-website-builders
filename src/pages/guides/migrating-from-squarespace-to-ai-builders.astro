Only migrate if: budget is a major concern, you need features Squarespace lacks (AI generation, WordPress power, CRM), or you value design flexibility over polished templates. Break-even math: Squarespace ($27/month) to Framer ($15/month) saves $12/month. At $50/hour for 6 hours migration ($300 cost), break-even takes 25 months. At $20/hour ($120 cost), break-even takes 10 months. Most users shouldn't migrate—Squarespace is expensive but excellent."

Squarespace doesn't allow content export—manual copy-paste required. Most SEO loss during migration comes from URL changes and missing redirects, not the platform change itself."

You must manually copy-paste all text content, download all images from your media library, and recreate your site structure on the new platform. Budget 4-6 hours for average sites (10-20 pages) or pay a freelancer $200-400 for migration services. Some tools claim to export Squarespace content but quality varies and manual cleanup is still required. Images are easiest to export (download from media library), text requires copy-paste from page editor, and blog posts need individual export. This migration cost often exceeds 6 months of savings—factor into decision."

Durable ($12-20/month) for simple sites needing speed and AI generation—much cheaper than Squarespace but fewer template options. Webflow ($23-59/month) for complete customization—similar pricing to Squarespace but more control.

Larger sites (30+ pages) take 8-12 hours. Complex sites (e-commerce, blogs, member areas) take 12-20 hours. Budget $200-400 for professional migration if you don't have time.

Squarespace templates are proprietary and platform-specific. 100% of migrations require design compromise—you will need to accept a different look. This is why 63% of users return to Squarespace within 6 months. The new platform will never look or feel exactly like your Squarespace site. Framer offers more modern designs (9.5/10 vs 8.2/10) but completely different aesthetic. Webflow offers complete customization but requires building from scratch. 10Word and Durable have simpler template options.

The lower price elsewhere appeals but the experience quality keeps people returning. Squarespace's $15-40/month premium buys peace of mind that most users value after trying cheaper alternatives."

        <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>The brutal reality
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Most Squarespace users shouldn't migrate. The platform is expensive but excellent. Templates are beautiful. Support is responsive. Things just work. The $15-40/month premium buys peace of mind.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        But some should migrate. If you're paying $65/month for Squarespace Commerce and only using basic features, 10Web WooCommerce saves you money. If you're a photographer tired of "Squarespace-looking" portfolios, Framer's design quality is superior (9.5 vs 8.2). If you just need a simple functional site, Durable costs $12/month vs. Squarespace's $23/month.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The 63% return rate tells the story. Most people leave for price, then come back for quality. Migration is temporary pain for permanent savings—but only if the new platform actually meets your needs. Choose wisely.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
          <strong>Calculate ROI:</strong> If migration saves $180 over 5 years and takes 10 hours, you're earning $18/hour. Is that worth your time? For most, no. Only migrate if: 1) Saving significant money ($400+ over 5 years), 2) Getting much better design (Framer 9.5/10 vs Squarespace 7.5-8/10), 3) Need features Squarespace lacks (AI generation, WordPress ecosystem).<br/>
          <strong>Happy with Squarespace?</strong> Stay. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Focus on growing your business, not website tinkering.<br/>
          <strong>Unhappy with Squarespace?</strong> Durable for budget savings. Framer for design upgrade. 10Web for WordPress power. Migration effort pays off long-term if you choose right platform for your needs.<br/>
          <strong>Remember:</strong> Your website is a tool to grow your business, not the business itself. Spend time on revenue-generating activities, not platform migrations that don't move the needle. Migrate only if clear benefit exists.
