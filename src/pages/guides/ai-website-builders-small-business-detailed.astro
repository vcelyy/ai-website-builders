Durable offers built-in CRM features with fastest setup (30 seconds) ideal for lead generation and business automation. Squarespace works well for local retail and image-focused businesses wanting beautiful product displays and professional polish. Framer delivers the best designs in class (9.5/10) for design-conscious businesses wanting modern aesthetic. For most small businesses, prioritize: clear contact information and location details, mobile optimization (most traffic is mobile), business hours and services prominently displayed, lead capture forms for inquiries, social media and review links, fast loading speed, and professional appearance that builds trust. Your website exists to get customers to contact you or visit your location - optimize for that conversion goal."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "AI website builders are absolutely sufficient for 95% of small businesses. Modern AI builders create professional small business websites with all essential features - contact forms, location information, service displays, mobile optimization, and professional designs. Custom development costs thousands more and takes weeks longer. The only small businesses that might need custom websites are those with: highly specific technical requirements, complex inventory management systems, unique interactive features, or substantial budget for differentiation. For restaurants, retail, professional services, local businesses, and most small companies, AI builders provide professional results at a fraction of the cost and time of custom development. Your customers care about: finding your location, seeing your hours, understanding what you offer, and easily contacting you. AI builders handle all of this beautifully. Invest your limited budget in business growth, not custom website development."

Essential: make it easy to find you, understand what you offer, and contact you. Everything should drive customer action - call, visit, or email. Your website is your 24/7 salesperson - ensure it can effectively answer questions and convert visitors into customers even when you\'re closed or busy."
