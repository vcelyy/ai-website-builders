              Friend built beautiful clothing store on Durable. AI generated stunning product pages, checkout looked great. Launched, got 500 visitors day 1. Zero sales. Why? Durable's checkout doesn't connect to real payment processors. Can't manage inventory. Can't track orders. It's a product catalog, not an ecommerce platform. Rebuilt on 10Web + WooCommerce. Same products, same design. Week 1: 47 orders. Pretty sites don't sell. Functional stores do.

Durable's checkout is front-end only. No backend order processing. No inventory management. Can't actually sell. It's a product catalog, not ecommerce platform. Rebuilt on WooCommerce. Same products, actual sales. Pretty but useless vs functional but less pretty. Choose functional.</p>

Options: upgrade to $46/month plan or delete products. Upgraded. Yearly cost: $552 vs WooCommerce at $120/year. AI builders make starting easy. Scaling gets expensive fast.

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-1">Squarespace, Wix charge transaction fees on lower plans. 3% doesn't sound like much. On $10,000 monthly revenue: $300/month. $3,600/year. That's 3 years of WooCommerce hosting. Transaction fees are recurring tax on growth. As you scale, fees scale with you. Pay more upfront, save thousands later.</p>

						<strong>Quick reality check:</strong> Most AI builders are marketing sites, not ecommerce platforms. Durable, Framer, Mixo create beautiful product catalogs but can't process real payments, manage inventory, or handle shipping. For serious online stores, you need 10Web + WooCommerce, Squarespace Commerce, or Webflow Ecommerce. Everything else is a toy that will cost you months to rebuild later.

					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>What actually matters for ecommerce</h2>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Real payment processing, not fake checkout</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Durable, Framer have checkout forms that look real. But they don't connect to payment processors properly. No order management. No inventory tracking. No shipping calculations. It's front-end theater, not backend commerce. For real sales, you need: Stripe/PayPal integration, order management system, inventory tracking, shipping calculations, tax automation. WooCommerce, Squarespace Commerce, Webflow Ecommerce have this. AI site builders don't.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Unlimited products, not surprise limits</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Squarespace basic: 1,000 products. Wix basic: 100 products. You'll hit these faster than expected. Each variant counts as a product. T-shirt in 5 sizes, 3 colors = 15 products. 50 t-shirts = 750 products. 100 t-shirts = 1,500 products. You're over limit before you know it. WooCommerce: unlimited products. 10,000 SKUs? No problem. Plan for growth or rebuild later.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Zero transaction fees save thousands at scale</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Some builders charge 2-3% on every sale. 3% of $10,000 = $300/month. $3,600/year. That's pure profit lost to platform fees. WooCommerce: 0% transaction fees. You pay payment processor fees (Stripe: 2.9% + $0.30). That's it. No platform tax on top. At $50k/month revenue, that's $1,500/month saved. Scale without penalty.

					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Ecommerce platform reality</h2>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">10Web + WooCommerce: most powerful, steepest learning curve</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					WooCommerce powers 30% of all online stores. Unlimited products, 100+ payment gateways, 50,000+ extensions. Need subscriptions? Plugin. Need bookings? Plugin. Need international shipping? Plugin. Anything ecommerce can do, WooCommerce does. But: WordPress learning curve. Plugin management. Security updates. Not for non-technical users. Best for serious stores prioritizing power over simplicity.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Squarespace Commerce: easiest, most expensive at scale</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Beautiful templates. Built-in ecommerce. No plugins needed. Inventory, shipping, taxes included. Easy to set up, easy to manage. But: product limits, transaction fees on lower plans, expensive scaling. Basic plan: 1,000 products, $23/month. Advanced: $46/month. Transaction fees: 3% on basic, 0% on advanced. Perfect for 10-500 products. Expensive beyond that.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Webflow Ecommerce: designer-focused, premium pricing</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Beautiful checkout flows. Custom product pages. Full design control. Results are stunning. But: $212/month minimum. Complex setup. Not for beginners. If design is your brand and budget is unlimited, Webflow delivers. For everyone else, overkill.
