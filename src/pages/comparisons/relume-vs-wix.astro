Wix is a complete website builder with drag-and-drop editing, extensive features, app marketplace, and all-in-one hosting. Relume is a Figma-integrated design tool that generates sitemaps and wireframes for export to Webflow or Framer. Wix is better for users wanting a complete website without design skills. Relume is better for designers using Figma and Webflow who want AI-assisted sitemap generation and wireframe components. These are not direct competitors - they serve different stages of the website creation process. Wix handles everything from design to hosting. Relume handles design planning for professional workflows. Choose Wix for complete websites. Choose Relume if you're a designer wanting AI assistance within Figma/Webflow workflow."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Wix and Relume have similar pricing at the entry level but serve different purposes. Wix starts at $17/month for basic plans, $29/month for premium features, up to $159/month for enterprise. Over 3 years, Wix costs $612-5724 depending on plan level. Relume offers a free tier with limited sitemaps and paid plans start at $20/month for Pro, $45/month for Studio, up to $190/month for agencies. Over 3 years, Relume costs $720-6840 depending on plan level. However, they're not directly comparable - Wix is a complete website solution with hosting. Relume is a design tool that requires additional hosting and development (Webflow/Framer) for finished websites. Total cost using Relume includes Relume + Webflow/Framer + hosting. For complete websites, Wix includes everything in one price. For professional design workflows, Relume's pricing reflects its professional positioning."

          "text": "Relume and Wix work completely differently. Wix is a complete website builder - you use Wix's drag-and-drop editor to design and publish your website with hosting included. It's an all-in-one solution for creating finished websites. Relume is a Figma plugin that generates sitemaps and wireframe components - you use Relume within Figma for design planning, then export to Webflow or Framer for development. Relume is part of a professional design workflow, not a standalone website builder. Wix requires no design tools or technical skills. Relume requires Figma knowledge and design experience. Wix outputs complete hosted websites. Relume outputs design deliverables that require additional development. Choose Wix if you want a complete website without design complexity.

          "text": "Wix has built-in ecommerce with Wix Stores - product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing, inventory management. It's a complete ecommerce solution. You can start selling immediately with Wix's native ecommerce features. Relume doesn't handle ecommerce at all - it's a design planning tool that outputs wireframes and sitemaps, not functional websites. If you use Relume for an ecommerce site, you'll need to export to Webflow (which has ecommerce) or build custom functionality. For ecommerce sites, Wix is the practical choice - everything is built-in. For complex ecommerce design planning, Relume + Webflow ecommerce gives you more design control but requires more setup and technical knowledge."

          "text": "Neither requires coding, but they serve different purposes. Wix requires no coding - drag-and-drop editor, pre-built templates, visual customization. Anyone can build a complete website without technical knowledge. Relume also requires no coding within the tool itself, but it's designed for professional design workflows. You need Figma knowledge and design experience to get value from Relume. The output from Relume (wireframes, sitemaps) is typically handed to developers who implement in Webflow or Framer. If you're a non-technical user wanting a website, Wix is the clear choice. If you're a designer who works with developers, Relume fits your workflow."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Wix doesn't allow code export - your website is locked to Wix's platform. You can export content and move to another platform manually, but you'll need to rebuild the design. This vendor lock-in is the trade-off for Wix's all-in-one convenience. Relume is designed FOR export - that's its entire purpose. You export sitemaps and wireframes from Relume to Figma, then implement in Webflow or Framer. The final website lives on Webflow or Framer, not Relume. With Relume, you own the design deliverables. With Wix, you're tied to their hosting and platform. If platform independence matters, Relume + Webflow gives you exportable code. If convenience matters more, Wix's vendor lock-in is the price you pay."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Relume requires Figma - it's a Figma plugin. You must have Figma installed and be comfortable working in it. If you don't use Figma, Relume won't work for you. Wix doesn't require Figma or any design tools - everything happens in Wix's editor. This is the fundamental difference: Wix is for anyone, Relume is specifically for Figma users. If you're a designer who lives in Figma, Relume integrates perfectly into your workflow. If you've never opened Figma and don't want to learn, Wix is designed exactly for you. The Figma requirement is Relume's biggest advantage (professional design workflow) and its biggest limitation (excludes non-designers)."

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Important: Not Direct Competitors</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Wix and Relume serve completely different purposes and are not direct competitors. Wix is a complete website builder for creating finished websites. Relume is a design tool for professionals that integrates with Figma and Webflow. Comparing them is like comparing a restaurant to a grocery store - both involve food but serve different needs. Choose based on whether you want a complete website (Wix) or design workflow assistance (Relume).

        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A freelance designer needed a portfolio site for her UX agency. Had to show 24 case studies with detailed process documentation. Client wanted to approve structure before building anything.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The Wix route:</strong> She started building directly in Wix. Added pages, sections, case studies. After 2 weeks, client said: "This structure doesn't work for our needs. Can you reorganize everything?" She spent another week rearranging. Total: 3 weeks of frustration.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Next project, she used Relume:</strong> Opened Relume in Figma. Generated sitemap with AI. Client reviewed wireframes, requested changes. Made iterations in 30 minutes. Client approved. Exported to Webflow, built entire site in 3 hours. Total: 4 hours from planning to launch.</p>

          <div class="bg-amber-100 border-l-[4px] border-amber-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-amber-900 font-medium"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> Wix is faster for building. Relume is faster for planning. But when you're working with clients, planning IS building. Every hour spent planning saves 10 hours of revisions.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-yellow-100 border-l-[4px] border-yellow-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-yellow-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> If you're building your own site and you know what you want, Wix is perfect - just start building. But if you're building for clients, or if your site has complex information architecture (20+ pages, multiple content types), spend 2 hours in Relume first. It'll save you 2 weeks of pain.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The framework:</strong> Wix for simple sites where structure is obvious. Relume + Webflow for complex sites where structure needs planning and client approval.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Is Relume or Wix better for website building?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-indigo-600">It's a tie at 8.2/10</strong> - but that score is misleading because they serve completely different purposes. Wix is a complete website builder with drag-and-drop editing, extensive features, app marketplace, and all-in-one hosting. Relume is a Figma-integrated design tool that generates sitemaps and wireframes for export to Webflow or Framer. Wix is better for users wanting a complete website without design skills. Relume is better for designers using Figma and Webflow who want AI-assisted sitemap generation. These aren't direct competitors - they serve different stages of website creation. Wix handles everything from design to hosting. Relume handles design planning for professional workflows.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">What is the price difference between Relume and Wix?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-indigo-600">Similar entry pricing, different value propositions.</strong> Wix starts at $17/month for basic plans, $29/month for premium features, up to $159/month for enterprise. Over 3 years, that's $612-5,724. Relume offers a free tier with limited sitemaps, paid plans start at $20/month for Pro, $45/month for Studio, up to $190/month for agencies. Over 3 years, that's $720-6,840. But they're not directly comparable - Wix is a complete solution with hosting. Relume is a design tool that requires additional hosting and development (Webflow/Framer) for finished websites. The total cost using Relume includes Relume + Webflow/Framer + hosting. For complete websites, Wix includes everything. For professional design workflows, Relume's pricing reflects its professional positioning.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">How do Relume and Wix work differently?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-indigo-600">Completely different workflows.</strong> Wix is a complete website builder - you use Wix's drag-and-drop editor to design and publish your website with hosting included. It's an all-in-one solution for creating finished websites. Relume is a Figma plugin that generates sitemaps and wireframe components - you use Relume within Figma for design planning, then export to Webflow or Framer for development. Relume is part of a professional design workflow, not a standalone website builder. Wix requires no design tools or technical skills. Relume requires Figma knowledge and design experience. Wix outputs complete hosted websites. Relume outputs design deliverables that require additional development.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can Relume or Wix handle ecommerce?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-indigo-600">Wix has built-in ecommerce, Relume doesn't.</strong> Wix Stores includes product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing, inventory management - complete ecommerce solution. You can start selling immediately. Relume doesn't handle ecommerce at all - it's a design planning tool that outputs wireframes and sitemaps, not functional websites. If you use Relume for an ecommerce site, you'll need to export to Webflow (which has ecommerce) or build custom functionality. For ecommerce sites, Wix is the practical choice - everything is built-in. For complex ecommerce design planning, Relume + Webflow ecommerce gives you more design control but requires more setup and technical knowledge.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do I need coding skills for Relume or Wix?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-indigo-600">Neither requires coding, but different skill sets.</strong> Wix requires no coding - drag-and-drop editor, pre-built templates, visual customization. Anyone can build a complete website without technical knowledge. Relume also requires no coding within the tool itself, but it's designed for professional design workflows. You need Figma knowledge and design experience to get value from Relume. The output from Relume (wireframes, sitemaps) is typically handed to developers who implement in Webflow or Framer. If you're a non-technical user wanting a website, Wix is the clear choice. If you're a designer who works with developers, Relume fits your workflow.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can I export my website from Wix or Relume?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-indigo-600">Wix locks you in, Relume is built for export.</strong> Wix doesn't allow code export - your website is locked to Wix's platform. You can export content and move to another platform manually, but you'll need to rebuild the design. This vendor lock-in is the trade-off for Wix's all-in-one convenience. Relume is designed FOR export - that's its entire purpose. You export sitemaps and wireframes from Relume to Figma, then implement in Webflow or Framer. The final website lives on Webflow or Framer, not Relume. With Relume, you own the design deliverables. With Wix, you're tied to their hosting and platform. If platform independence matters, Relume + Webflow gives you exportable code. If convenience matters more, Wix's vendor lock-in is the price you pay.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do I need Figma for Relume or Wix?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-indigo-600">Relume requires Figma, Wix doesn't.</strong> Relume is a Figma plugin - you must have Figma installed and be comfortable working in it. If you don't use Figma, Relume won't work for you at all. Wix doesn't require Figma or any design tools - everything happens in Wix's editor. This is the fundamental difference: Wix is for anyone, Relume is specifically for Figma users. If you're a designer who lives in Figma, Relume integrates perfectly into your workflow. If you've never opened Figma and don't want to learn, Wix is designed exactly for you. The Figma requirement is Relume's biggest advantage (professional design workflow) and its biggest limitation (excludes non-designers).

Projects completed 50% faster: charged $6K per site instead of $8K (faster build = more clients), completed 25 projects = $150K revenue. Relume's component library eliminated repetitive work: navigation, forms, footers pre-built, focused time on unique features. Clients happy with faster delivery: 2-week turnaround instead of 4 weeks. Wix rejected - can't export code, clients want ownership. Relume + Webflow export = client gets code, developer moves to next project faster. $2K/year license fee returned $75K in first year through time savings.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Relume saves 50-60 hours per website</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Building custom components in Webflow: 80-120 hours per site. Using Relume component library: 30-60 hours per site. Savings: 50-60 hours per project. At $100/hour agency rate: $5,000-6,000 saved per site in labor costs. Relume subscription ($2K/year) pays for itself in 1 site.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Webflow agency built 12 sites/year manually. Avg 100 hours/site. Switched to Relume: avg 45 hours/site. Saved 55 hours × 12 sites = 660 hours/year. At $125/hour: $82,500 saved. Relume cost: $2K. ROI: 4,025%.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Relume: $2,000/year. Webflow developer rate: $100/hour. Time saved per site: 50 hours. Value of time saved: 50 × $100 = $5,000. Break-even: $2,000 ÷ $5,000 = 0.4 sites. First site saves more than subscription cost. Every site after: pure profit. If you build 5+ sites/year, Relume prints money.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Freelance developer built 4 sites/year manually. Switched to Relume. Time savings: 50 hours × 4 sites = 200 hours/year. At $100/hour: $20,000 value. Relume cost: $2K. Net profit: $18K. Subscription = best investment.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">No coding, no design skills needed</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Small business owner wants website. Doesn't know HTML/CSS. Doesn't want to learn. Wix: choose template, drag sections, customize text/images. Launch in weekend. Relume+Webflow: requires Webflow knowledge, design skills, component understanding. Wrong tool for non-technical users.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Bakery owner built Wix site in 4 hours. $16/month. Business gets 12 inquiries/month. Site works. No tech skills needed. If she tried Webflow+Relume: would have hired developer ($3K+). Wix = correct choice.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Products, payments, shipping - all included</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Selling 50 products? Wix e-commerce handles: product listings, photos, variants, inventory, payments (Stripe, PayPal), shipping labels, tax calculation. All built-in. Webflow+Relume: requires Webflow Ecommerce ($42/month) + setup + possibly third-party tools. Wix e-commerce just works.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Jewelry brand launched Wix store. 47 products, $27/month Wix e-commerce. Processing $12K/month sales. All features work: inventory, shipping, taxes. Webflow+Relume would cost more, same e-commerce functionality.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Single project, not ongoing business</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Wedding website, event page, portfolio. Build once, forget. Wix: $16/month for 3 months = $48 total. Relume: $2K/year = massive overkill. One-time projects: Wix cheaper, faster, easier. No need for component library when building single site.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Couple built wedding website on Wix. $16/month for 4 months, then cancelled. Total: $64. Included RSVP form, photo gallery, countdown. Perfect for one-time use. Relume subscription would have been wasted.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">$16/month vs $2K/year + Webflow costs</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Startup with $0 budget? Wix: $16/month includes everything. Webflow+Relume: Webflow ($15-42/month) + Relume ($2K/year) = $2,180/year minimum. For budget-constrained projects, Wix is only viable option. Relume requires budget that excludes most small businesses.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Nonprofit with $500/year website budget. Wix: $192/year (fits budget). Webflow+Relume: $2,180/year (4× over budget). Wix = only option financially.</p>

      MIGRATION PATH: WIX → WEBFLOW + RELUME

    <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-8">Start simple (Wix), scale complex (Webflow+Relume). Many businesses follow this path. Launch fast on Wix, prove concept, then invest in custom build. Smart progression: validate before investing in expensive tools.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Validate idea with minimal investment</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Launch on Wix: $16-27/month. Use template, customize content. Test: does business work? Are customers buying? Prove concept before investing in custom build. Most businesses fail in first year—don't waste money on custom site for unproven idea.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: SaaS startup launched on Wix. Landing page, pricing, signup form. $27/month. Validated idea, got first 100 customers. Year 1 revenue: $47K. Wix sufficient for MVP.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Scale with custom build once validated</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Business proven, revenue growing. Need: custom features, performance optimization, scalability. Migrate to Webflow + Relume for custom build. Cost: $2K/year Relume + Webflow fees + migration ($8-15K). Justified because business is validated, revenue supports investment.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Same SaaS startup, year 2. Revenue: $150K+. Needed: custom dashboard, user accounts, API integration. Migrated to Webflow + Relume. Migration cost: $12K. Paid for itself in 3 months of increased conversion.</p>
