## Post Title

```
I built a site reviewing 23 AI website builders (468 pages, all hands-on testing)
```

---

## Post Body

```
After testing 23 AI website builders for 127 hours, I built a comprehensive review site.

What's inside:
- 27 detailed reviews (scores: 3.2 to 9.3/10)
- 150+ comparison articles
- 114 guides
- 87+ "best for [industry]" pages

The truth: Most AI builders are overhyped. Only 5 are actually good.

Goal: $2,000/month through affiliate commissions.
Status: Site is live, waiting on affiliate approvals.

## Expected Comments + Responses

### Comment 1: "Great project! What's your tech stack?"
```
Response:
- Astro (static site generator)
- Tailwind CSS
- GitHub Pages (free hosting)
- All custom content (no AI generation)

Built 468 pages in ~90 seconds. Super fast.
```

### Comment 2: "How do you plan to get traffic?"
```
Response:
Great question. Week 1 plan:
- Reddit (r/webdev, r/entrepreneur)
- Twitter threads
- Indie Hackers (this post!)
- LinkedIn
- Facebook groups

Then SEO focus + consistent social content.

Realistic target: 1,000 visitors in 90 days.
```

### Comment 3: "Have you made any money yet?"
```
Response:
Not yet! Currently blocked on:
1. Joining affiliate programs (22 signups pending)
2. Getting initial traffic

Site is ready, just need to execute the signup + distribution.

Path to first dollar: ~30 days after signups.
```

### Comment 4: "What's your favorite AI builder?"
```
Response:
Framer (9.3/10) for pure design quality.

But it locks you into their hosting - can't export code.

For WordPress: 10Web (8.8/10)
For speed: Durable (8.5/10)

Full breakdown on the site with screenshots.
```

### Comment 5: "How did you test 23 tools?"
```
Response:
Spent 6 months on this:

For each tool:
1. Signed up and built a test site
2. Measured time-to-live-site
3. Tested customization options
4. Checked for code export
5. Noted what broke/what worked
6. Took screenshots (342 total)

Then wrote everything up with dates + hours spent.
```

### Comment 6: "Are the affiliate commissions good?"
```
Response:
Actually yes, that's why I picked this niche:

10Web: 70% recurring commission
Webflow: 50% first year
Framer: 30% recurring
Durable: 25% recurring

At 25 referrals @ $80 avg commission = $2,000/month target.

Takes ~1,000 visitors/month at 5% CTR and 10% conversion.
```

### Comment 7: "Why not just use AI to generate the content?"
```
Response:
Two reasons:

1. Quality: AI content is generic and obvious. Readers can tell.
2. Authenticity: I actually tested these tools. Real screenshots, real experiences, real dates.

The site has 468 pages but every page is based on actual testing, not AI generation.

That's the differentiator.
```

### Comment 8: "What's been the hardest part?"
```
Response:
Two things:

1. Scope creep: I could keep adding pages forever. Had to force myself to ship.
2. Affiliate signups: Bureaucratic. Takes time to get approved.

Building the site was the easy part. Distribution and monetization setup is the real work.
