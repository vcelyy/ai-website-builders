            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Initially rated Framer 8.5/10. Thought it was "good but overhyped." The landing pages felt generic. The AI generation was hit-or-miss.
            </p>

            <h3 class="font-black text-green-900 mb-3">What Changed My Mind</h3>

            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 ml-4">
              <li><strong>Spent 20 hours actually learning Framer.</strong> The "generic" feeling was my lack of skill. Once I understood how to customize, the designs became incredible.</li>
              <li><strong>Framer added features.</strong> Better CMS, improved AI generation, faster performance. The tool I rated 8.5 is now 9.3.</li>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Some tools require investment.</strong> Framer rewards time spent learning. Durable is instant but limited. Neither is "better"—they serve different users.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
              I was judging Framer by "instant gratification" standards. That was wrong. Framer is a power tool, not a toy.

              Hated Webflow at first. Called it "overcomplicated" and "elitist." Gave it a 7.5/10 initially. Thought it was only for agencies.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Built a complex site for a client. Needed CMS, dynamic content, custom interactions. Tried Framer, Durable, Squarespace—all failed.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Webflow handled it. The "overcomplicated" features became necessary. The "elitist" learning curve was the price of power.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Beginners and experts need different tools.</strong> I was reviewing Webflow from a beginner's perspective. That's like reviewing a Ferrari as a family car—wrong use case.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
              Updated score: 8.7/10. But with a huge caveat: <em>not for beginners.</em> If you're non-technical, avoid Webflow. If you're a designer or developer, it's unmatched.

              Tried actually exporting from Framer. Got a React project. Spent 4 hours trying to deploy. Realized you need React knowledge to use it.
