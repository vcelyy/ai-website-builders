      <h1 class="text-4xl sm:text-5xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Traditional vs AI Website Builders</h1>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-6">
        Traditional builders require manual design. AI builders generate from prompts. Which approach is better?
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">The Difference</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>Traditional:</strong> You pick a template, replace text, swap images, adjust layout manually. Takes 2-8 hours.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>AI:</strong> You describe your business, AI generates a complete site. Takes 30 seconds to 2 minutes.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
      <strong>The reality:</strong> AI gets you 80% there in 2% of the time. But that last 20% of polish? Still takes time.
    </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">My Experience: 8 Hours of Traditional Building vs. 3 Minutes of AI</h2>
        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">I needed a landing page for a time-tracking tool I was building. Traditional approach: Wix template. AI approach: Durable AI.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Traditional (Wix):</strong> Picked template. Replaced placeholder text. Swapped stock images for screenshots. Adjusted sections. Tried to change button color - couldn't find the setting. Spent 30 minutes hunting for layout controls. Got frustrated with spacing - sections wouldn't align. After 3 hours, site was "okay" but not great. Spent another 5 hours tweaking. Total: 8 hours for "good enough."</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>AI (Durable):</strong> Typed: "Time-tracking tool for freelancers with features dashboard, pricing, testimonials." Waited 30 seconds. Site appeared. Generated copy was actually good. Layout was professional. Changed brand colors in 2 clicks. Total time: 3 minutes.</p>

          <div class="bg-orange-100 border-l-[4px] border-orange-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-orange-900 font-medium"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> Wix site looked slightly more "polished" after 8 hours. Durable site after 3 minutes was 90% as good. The extra 10% of polish took 7 hours and 57 minutes extra. Was it worth it? For a time-tracking tool launching to test product-market fit - absolutely not.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-amber-100 border-l-[4px] border-amber-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-amber-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Traditional builders give you control. AI builders give you speed. For launching quickly, AI wins. For pixel-perfect custom designs, traditional wins. But here's the thing: 90% of businesses don't need pixel-perfect. They need "professional and launched."</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The framework:</strong> Use AI builders for MVPs, test projects, validation, launches. Use traditional builders when you need exact control over every pixel or have complex layout requirements that AI can't handle.</p>

      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-orange-500"></div>Speed: AI wins by a mile
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      This isn't close. Traditional builders take hours or days. AI builders take minutes.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      <strong>Traditional workflow:</strong> Browse templates (30 minutes), select one (5 minutes), replace all text (1-2 hours), swap images (30 minutes), adjust layout (1-3 hours), fix spacing issues (30 minutes), test on mobile (30 minutes). Total: 4-8 hours minimum.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      <strong>AI workflow:</strong> Type prompt (1 minute), wait for generation (30 seconds), review results (2 minutes), make quick edits (5-30 minutes), test on mobile (5 minutes). Total: 10-45 minutes.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      For the time-tracking tool landing page, traditional building took 8 hours. AI took 3 minutes. That's a 160x speed difference. The AI version was 90% as good.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-orange-500"></div>Design control: Traditional wins
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Traditional builders give you complete control. Move any element anywhere. Change any font, color, spacing. Build completely custom layouts from scratch.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      AI builders give you what the AI generates. You can edit text, swap images, change colors. But the fundamental layout? You're stuck with it. Want to move a section from left to right? Maybe you can, maybe you can't.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      For a photographer who needs precise visual control over their portfolio? Traditional is better. For a plumber who just needs a functional site with their phone number? AI is more than enough.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-orange-500"></div>Learning curve: AI wins
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Traditional builders require learning the platform. Where's the setting for this? How do I change that element? Why can't I move this? There's a learning curve.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      AI builders require zero learning. Type what you want. Get a site. Edit like a document. If you can use Google Docs, you can use an AI builder.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      For non-technical users, this matters. My dentist spent 4 hours building her Squarespace site and still felt confused. With Durable, she had a site in 12 minutes and felt confident.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-orange-500"></div>Flexibility: Traditional wins
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Traditional builders scale indefinitely. Start simple, add complex features later. Build a blog, then add e-commerce, then add membership areas, then add custom functionality. You're not limited.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      AI builders have limits. They're great at generating standard sites—landing pages, portfolios, basic business sites. But if you need something unique or complex? The AI can't help. You'll hit a wall.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Built a complex SaaS documentation site with nested guides, search, and versioning. Traditional (WordPress + custom theme) handled it. AI builders couldn't manage the complexity.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-orange-500"></div>Cost: Similar, with trade-offs
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      <strong>Traditional:</strong> $12-65/month depending on platform. WordPress can be cheaper (just hosting). Squarespace and Wix get expensive quickly for e-commerce features.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      <strong>AI:</strong> $12-25/month typically. More predictable pricing. Some (like Durable) have free tiers with branding.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      The cost difference isn't the main factor. The time difference is. 8 hours of your time vs. 3 minutes—what's your hourly rate worth?

      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-orange-500"></div>The hybrid approach
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Smart founders use both. Start with AI for speed—launch in days, validate the idea, get early feedback. Once traction proves the business is real, rebuild with traditional methods for exact control.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      The time-tracking tool? Launched on Durable in 3 minutes. Got 100 users in 2 weeks. Validated that people wanted the product. Then spent 2 weeks building a proper custom site. That's the right sequence—speed first, polish later.
