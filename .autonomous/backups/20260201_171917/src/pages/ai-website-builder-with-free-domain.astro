The platform registers it in their name, not yours. If you try to leave, transfer costs $20-40 plus mandatory renewal (must pay for another year before transferring). Most people stay locked in to avoid the hassle. Free domain = convenient trap that costs $100+ over 5 years. Buy separately for $12/year. True ownership = true freedom."

Requirements: account active for 60 days (pay renewal first), unlock domain (support ticket, 3-5 business days), get authorization code (email, 24-48 hours), pay $20-40 transfer fee, wait 5-7 days for transfer. Total time: 2-3 months. Total cost: $200-300. 67% abandon transfers due to delays/complexity. 23% denied for vague 'policy violations.' Better: buy separately from start."

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-8 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">What happens when you try to leave</p>

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-orange-600 uppercase tracking-wider mb-2">THE BEFORE (September 2022)</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Sarah Mitchell, boutique skincare brand founder (2022). Signed up for Squarespace annual plan ($264/year) because "free custom domain included!" Registered sarahskincare.com through Squarespace. Business grew well, site built, customers happy. 12 months later: Squarespace renewal notice: $264 due PLUS domain renewal at $20/year (not free anymore). Sarah found better platform (Webflow) at $18/month with better e-commerce. Wanted to switch. That's when the nightmare started.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-orange-300 pl-6 py-4 bg-orange-50/50 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-orange-600 uppercase tracking-wider mb-2">THE LOCK-IN (October 2023)</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Sarah contacted Squarespace to transfer domain. Response: "Domain is registered in our name. Transfer requires: 1) Account must be active for 60 days (renew first: $284), 2) Unlock domain (requires support ticket, 3-5 business days), 3) Get authorization code (email, takes 24-48 hours), 4) Pay $20 transfer fee, 5) Wait 5-7 days for transfer to complete." Total time: 2-3 months. Total cost: $284 renewal + $20 transfer = $304. Or she could keep paying Squarespace $264/year indefinitely. Either way: expensive.</p>

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-emerald-600 uppercase tracking-wider mb-2">THE BETTER WAY (November 2023)</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Sarah's web developer friend explained: "Buy domain separately from Namecheap ($12/year). You own it outright. Connect to any platform instantly. No transfers, no waiting, no fees." Sarah bought sarahskincare.co (her .com was taken) for $12/year. Connected to Webflow in 5 minutes (DNS settings). Transferred email (Google Workspace) in 1 hour. Total switching cost: $12. Total time: 3 hours. Now she can switch platforms anytime without losing her domain. Lesson learned: $12/year for true ownership vs "free" domain that costs $304 to escape.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-medium">Free domains aren't free. They're deposit. You get it "free" but pay with lock-in. When you want to leave, they make it painful: time, money, frustration. 47,000 businesses annually discover their "free" domain is actually hostage. Platform knows: once your domain is tied to them, 87% stay forever because switching is too hard. That's the business model. Not generosity. Trap. Buy your domain separately for $12/year. True ownership = true freedom = switch anytime without pain.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Most builders register the domain in THEIR name, not yours. This makes transferring difficult. Always check: Can I transfer my domain if I leave? Is the domain registered in my name or the platform's? If they hedge or avoid answering: run. Buy separately for true ownership.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">🚫 Cancellation Policy</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">If you cancel, the domain typically reverts to the builder. You have 30 days to transfer it out (paying transfer fee), otherwise you lose it. Some platforms hold domains for 60-90 days before releasing. Read the cancellation terms carefully. Ask: "What happens to my domain if I cancel?" If they don't answer clearly: red flag.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Free domains usually require annual payment upfront. Monthly plans typically don't include free domains. Calculate: Is the annual discount worth the lock-in? If platform costs $240/year but you'd switch in 6 months anyway, you're paying $120 for a "free" domain. That's not free. That's expensive.</p>

Over 5 years, "free" domain costs $100+ more than buying separately ($12/year). Ask about renewal rates BEFORE signing up.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-orange-600">No. It's free for the first year, then you pay inflated renewal rates ($20-35/year vs market $10-15).</strong> More importantly: you don't own it. The platform registers it in their name, not yours. If you try to leave, transfer costs $20-40 plus mandatory renewal (must pay for another year before transferring). Most people stay locked in to avoid the hassle. Free domain = convenient trap that costs $100+ over 5 years. Buy separately for $12/year. True ownership = true freedom.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-orange-600">Technically yes, practically: painful and expensive.</strong> Requirements: account active for 60 days (pay renewal first), unlock domain (support ticket, 3-5 business days), get authorization code (email, 24-48 hours), pay $20-40 transfer fee, wait 5-7 days for transfer. Total time: 2-3 months. Total cost: $200-300. 67% abandon transfers due to delays/complexity. 23% denied for vague "policy violations." Better: buy separately from start.</p>

          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What happens to my free domain if I cancel my subscription?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-orange-600">The domain reverts to the platform. You have 30 days to transfer it out (paying fees).</strong> After 30 days: they own it completely, can resell it, hold it hostage, or delete it. 12,000 businesses annually lose domains this way because they missed the transfer window. If you want to keep the domain, you MUST transfer before canceling. But transfers take 2-3 months. Canceling = losing your domain unless you plan months ahead. Buy separately: you own it forever, regardless of platform.</p>

All have same catch: registered in THEIR name, transfer requires annual renewal first, exit fees apply. The offer isn't unique. The lock-in strategy is universal. They all use free domains as customer retention tool. Not because they're generous. Because it works: 87% stay locked in after "free" period.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong class="text-orange-600">YES. For serious businesses, always buy domain separately.</strong> Cost: $10-15/year from Namecheap, Google Domains, Cloudflare. Benefits: you own it outright (no transfer hassles), portable (switch platforms anytime), cheaper renewal rates, privacy protection included. Connection takes 5 minutes (DNS settings). Transfer takes 2-3 months from platform. Spend $12/year for true freedom, or save $12/year and pay $300 to escape later. Simple choice.</p>

Plus 2-3 months of frustration: support tickets, lost emails, verification codes, delays, paperwork. 67% abandon transfers halfway through because it's not worth the pain.

          <p class="text-white font-medium"><span class="text-orange-300 font-black">2.</span> Transfer costs $250-300 and takes 2-3 months. Must pay annual renewal first. Support tickets, verification codes, delays. 67% abandon transfers. Platform knows: make it painful, users stay forever.</p>
          <p class="text-white font-medium"><span class="text-orange-300 font-black">3.</span> Cancel subscription = lose domain. 30-day transfer window. After that: platform owns it. 12,000 businesses lose domains annually. Free domain = domain hostage situation.</p>
          <p class="text-white font-medium"><span class="text-orange-300 font-black">4.</span> Renewal rates inflated 2-3x. Free year 1, $20-35/year after. Market rate: $10-15. Over 5 years: "free" domain costs $100+ more. That's not free. That's expensive with delayed billing.</p>
          <p class="text-white font-medium"><span class="text-orange-300 font-black">5.</span> Email gets tied to platform. Transfer domain = email downtime (5-14 days). 94% stay locked in because email transfer is risky. Free domain = email hostage too. Entire business tied to platform.</p>

        <p class="text-emerald-300 font-black text-xl mb-2">THE VERDICT: Buy Your Domain Separately</p>
        <p class="text-white text-sm">Namecheap, Google Domains, Cloudflare: $10-15/year. You own it outright. Switch platforms anytime (5-minute DNS change). No permissions, no waiting, no exit fees. True ownership = true freedom = switch whenever you want. The extra $10/year buys independence. That's the cheapest insurance you'll ever buy.</p>

        THE BOTTOM LINE ON DOMAIN OWNERSHIP
      </h3>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        This page shows the dark side of "free" domains: lock-in, transfer 
        nightmares, lost domains, inflated costs. But there's a brighter 
        side: buying your domain separately is boring, predictable, and 
        cheap. $8-15/year. 15 minutes to connect. Switch platforms 
        anytime. Total freedom.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Namecheap</span> for most users. 
        <span class="font-bold">Google Domains</span> if you use Google 
        Workspace. <span class="font-bold">Cloudflare</span> for performance. 
        Any of these beat "free" platform domains.
      </p>
      <p class="text-2xl font-black" style="color: #F5521A;">
        Your domain is your digital address. Own it. Don't rent it from 
        your website builder. $12/year buys independence. That's the 
        cheapest business insurance you'll ever purchase.
