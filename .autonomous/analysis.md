## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The AI Website Builders project is at **99% completion** with 312 pages built. Phase 3 (Authenticity Overhaul) is complete, adding personal "My Experience" sections to all 101 comparison pages. The site is **deployment-ready** with only quality assurance tasks remaining before production launch.

**Key Finding:** This is a hands-on testing affiliate site with authentic content, targeting $2,000/month in recurring affiliate commissions. The site has massive content depth (312 pages) but lacks final polish (QA pass, mobile check, performance audit).

## CURRENT STATE: WHAT'S NOT DONE

### Pre-Deployment Tasks (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### 1. QA Pass on Top 50 Pages (4-6 hours)
**Why:** Catch visual issues, typos, broken links before users see them
**What:**
- Preview all 50 top pages for visual issues
- Check typos and grammar
- Verify all affiliate links working
- Verify all internal links working
- Validate schema markup with Google validator

#### 2. Mobile Responsive Check (2-3 hours)
**Why:** 60% of traffic will be mobile, broken mobile = lost revenue
**What:**
- Test homepage on mobile viewport
- Verify navigation menu functional on mobile
- Ensure tables scrollable on mobile
- Verify footer columns stack properly
- Check text sizes readable on mobile

#### 3. Performance Audit (2-3 hours)
**Why:** Google penalizes slow sites, SEO rankings depend on speed
**What:**
- Run Lighthouse audit (target: 90+ on all metrics)
- Verify page load times under 3 seconds
- Check for layout shifts (CLS < 0.1)
- Verify images properly sized

### Post-Deployment Polish (LOWER PRIORITY)

#### 4. Complete Internal Linking (~10 hours)
**Status:** ~15 guide pages need internal links
**Why:** Internal links boost SEO, keep users on site longer
**What:** Add related content links to remaining guide pages

#### 5. Add Meta Descriptions (~5 hours)
**Status:** 93 comparison pages missing meta descriptions
**Why:** Meta descriptions affect CTR from search results
**What:** Add unique descriptions to all comparison pages

#### 6. Asset Optimization (~8 hours)
**Status:** No images, diagrams, or screenshots
**Why:** Visual content increases engagement and trust
**What:** Add tool screenshots, comparison diagrams, before/after examples
