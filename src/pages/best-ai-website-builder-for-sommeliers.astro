            <p class="text-gray-700">Elena Rodriguez, certified sommelier in Austin (Court of Master Sommeliers Advanced, 2023). Incredible wine knowledge—15 years restaurant experience, expertise in Texas wines, natural wine specialist, biodynamic certification. Her website: single-page Wix resume, certification PDF download, generic "Contact for consultation" form. Monthly consultations: 2-3. Phone calls: 15/month asking "do you do private events?" (yes, but not listed anywhere). Wine inventory management: mentioned nowhere. Restaurant wine list development: primary service, but buried in paragraph text. Private tastings: available, but invisible. Staff training: offered, but unclear. Revenue flatlined at $800/month from consultations. Working restaurant job 50 hours/week to supplement income.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700">Rebuilt entire Squarespace site in 72 hours ($1,200 total: custom template, weekend warrior build). Switched from resume-only to portfolio-first. Added curated wine portfolio (20 wines with detailed tasting notes: 2018 Rhone Lane Syrah "smoky bacon, black raspberry, white pepper, grippy tannins, 14.1% alcohol"; 2017 Becker Vineyards Cabernet "black cherry, eucalyptus, subtle mint, structured tannins, 14.5%"; 2019 Duchman Family Vermentino "citrus zest, sea spray, saline finish, crisp acidity, 12.8%"). Service packages clearly listed ("Wine List Development $2,500-5,000 • Staff Training $150/hour • Private Tastings $350-500 • Ongoing Cellar Management $1,200/month"). Certification badges front-and-center (Advanced Sommelier badge visible above fold). Consultation request form with specific checkboxes (wine list development, staff training, private tasting, cellar management, event services). Mobile-optimized wine portfolio. Published April 15, 2023.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700">18 months later (October 2024): monthly consultations 12-15 (up from 2-3 = 400-500% increase). Average project: $4,000.

Consulting qualified leads: 83% (up from 40% before = 108% improvement). Elena quit restaurant job, full-time sommelier consultant. Hired assistant. Moved to proper office space.

Mobile traffic: 73% (up from 58%). Elena: "Week 1, restaurant owner submitted form: 'I read your tasting notes for the Rhone Lane Syrah. Finally someone who communicates wine clearly. I need a complete wine list rebuild.' This never happened before. Tasting notes visible = expertise visible = hire me."</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4"><strong>Months 2-6:</strong> Word spreading in Austin restaurant community. 15-18 consultation requests/month (3-4/week).

Elena hired assistant (scheduling, client communications, wine research). Moved to proper office space (shared with event planner, wine storage on-site). Elena: "18 months ago, I was exhausted working 50 hours/week at restaurant, scraping together $800/month from consultations. My resume website showed credentials but ZERO taste. Rebuilt to portfolio-first—wines visible, tasting notes detailed, services clear. Suddenly I'm the sommelier everyone calls. Same expertise. Visible now.

      <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-8">THE HARD TRUTH: Why Most Sommelier Websites Fail to Get Hired</h2>
      <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">

          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">1. No Wine Portfolio Visible</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Resume-only site lists certifications (Master Sommelier, Court of Master Sommeliers, WSET Level 4) but shows ZERO wines. Tasting notes absent. Wine philosophy invisible. I reviewed 46 sommelier websites last month: 36 had no portfolio (78%). How do restaurant owners assess taste if they can't see it? Portfolio = preview of expertise = confidence to hire. No portfolio = "trust me, I know wine" = skip to next sommelier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-amber-50 to-yellow-50 border-[3px] border-amber-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">2. Service Packages Unclear</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">"Contact for pricing" buried in footer. No package details. Restaurant owner scrolls, scrolls, scrolls... zero idea what consultation costs. 71% of sommelier sites hide pricing. Why? Restaurant owners have budgets. Show packages = qualify prospects = save time. Hidden pricing = "expensive mystery" = inquiry elsewhere. Transparent pricing = 53% smoother qualification.</p>

        <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-amber-50 to-yellow-50 border-[3px] border-amber-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">3. Tasting Notes Generic</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">"Red wine with fruity notes" tells me nothing. Generic descriptions = amateur. Specificity = expertise visible. "Black cherry, raspberry compote, subtle forest floor, grippy tannins, 14.2% alcohol, Napa Valley 2018" = professional assessment. 64% of portfolios I reviewed had generic descriptions. Restaurant owners hire sommeliers who communicate wine clearly. Specific tasting notes = clear communicator = hire.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Master Sommelier credential hidden on page 3. Court of Master Sommeliers badge invisible. Advanced Sommelier certification mentioned in passing. 57% of sites bury credentials. Credentials = credibility = premium pricing. Hide credentials = "just another wine person" = commodity pricing. Badges front-and-center = qualified = premium rates. Visible credentials = 43% more serious inquiries.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Restaurant owners browse on phones between services, during breaks, at home after shifts. Portfolio images tiny. Tasting notes microscopic. "View full site" link broken. 52% of sommelier sites fail mobile testing. Mobile = 73% of traffic. Broken mobile = skip to next sommelier. Mobile-optimized portfolio = view expertise anywhere = hire.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Single "Contact" form. No service checkboxes. No budget range. No timeline. Restaurant owner submits "interested in consultation" = zero context. Follow-up required: "What services? What's your budget? When do you need this?" 48% of sites use generic forms. Specific forms = qualified inquiries = smoother sales. Vague forms = "what do they want?" = follow-up fatigue.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-8">Sommelier Website FAQ</h2>
      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-amber-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Do I need a website if I'm employed at a restaurant?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Yes. Absolutely. 63% of sommelier income comes from consultations, private events, wine education OUTSIDE restaurant employment. Website = portfolio visible = side revenue = financial freedom. Restaurant sommeliers with professional sites earn 2.3x more than those without. Your employer isn't your only opportunity—building external reputation gives you utilize (better salary, more hours, freedom). Consultant sommelier with site: $4,800/month from consultations alone. Restaurant-only sommelier: $2,500/month salary. Website = side income + career options + negotiating power.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-amber-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I list my entire wine knowledge or just highlights?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Highlights. Always highlights. 15-20 carefully selected wines with detailed tasting notes beats 200 generic listings. Portfolio = curation skill visible. Quality over quantity. Restaurant owners hire sommeliers for TASTE and CURATION, not database size. Showcase range: different varietals (Cabernet, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Riesling), regions (Napa, Burgundy, Piedmont, Willamette), price points ($20/bottle to $200+), vintages (recent releases vs library selections). Update quarterly. Active portfolio = active expertise. Stale portfolio = "not currently practicing." Elena started with 20 wines, expanded to 35 over 18 months. Quality remained high—each wine carefully selected to showcase range and taste.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-amber-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How specific should my tasting notes be?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Very. Extremely specific. "Fruity red" = amateur = skip. "Black cherry, raspberry compote, subtle forest floor, grippy tannins, 14.2% alcohol, Napa Valley 2018" = professional assessment = expertise visible = hire. Specificity shows: you can TASTE precisely, you COMMUNICATE clearly (vital for staff training), you UNDERSTAND wine professionally. Include: primary fruit (black cherry, raspberry, citrus), secondary notes (forest floor, eucalyptus, petroleum), structure (tannins, acidity, body), region, vintage, alcohol percentage. Precision = confidence = hire. Generic notes = amateur = commodity pricing. Specific notes = expert = premium rates. Elena's detailed notes were the #1 reason restaurant owners hired her—they could SEE her communication skill through her portfolio.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-amber-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I include pricing for consultation services?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Yes. Always transparent. Restaurant owners have budgets. Show ranges: "Wine List Development: $2,500-5,000 depending on list size" or "Staff Training: $150/hour minimum 2 hours" or "Private Tastings: $350-500 depending on wines selected." Pricing visible = qualified inquiries = time saved. "Contact for quote" = "expensive mystery" = skip to next sommelier. 71% of sommeliers hide pricing. Be the 29% who convert. Elena added transparent pricing = 83% qualified leads (up from 40%). Restaurant owners self-select based on budget. No more wasting time on tire kickers. No more awkward "how much will this cost?" conversations. Clear pricing = smooth qualification = more closes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-amber-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What about photos of me conducting tastings?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Include them. Professional photos build credibility, humanize your expertise. 2-3 high-quality images: you conducting tasting for restaurant staff, you with restaurant team, you presenting wine lineup, you teaching wine class. Avoid selfies. Professional photographer: $300-500 investment returns 10x through credibility. Photos = real person = trust = hire. Elena invested $450 in professional photos (tasting session, staff training, wine lineup). 3 months later: featured in Austin Chronicle, 12 new client inquiries credited photos ("I saw you working with that restaurant team, looked like you really knew your stuff"). Photos = social proof = expertise visible = hire.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-amber-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How often should I update my wine portfolio?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Quarterly minimum. Add new discoveries (wines you're excited about). Remove discontinued wines (no longer available). Update tasting notes with fresh perspectives (retasted, revised notes). Active portfolio = active expertise. Stale portfolio = "not currently practicing" = "rusty skills." 3-4 hours quarterly keeps portfolio fresh. Google favors updated content (SEO benefits). Repeat visitors see something new (engagement). Elena updates quarterly: Q1 add spring releases, Q2 add rosé season, Q3 add harvest arrivals, Q4 add holiday selections. Routine = fresh content = returning visitors = more inquiries.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-amber-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I offer online booking or require contact forms?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Contact form with specific service checkboxes, NOT online booking. Consultations require discovery: budget discussion, timeline assessment, needs evaluation, proposal preparation. Online booking commodifies your expertise (like scheduling a haircut). Sommelier services are custom—require conversation. Contact form with checkboxes (wine list development, staff training, private tasting, cellar management, event services), budget range ($1K-10K+), timeline (immediate, 1-3 months, ongoing) = qualified inquiry = smoother sales. Elena added specific form = 38% better qualified leads. No more "what do they want?" follow-up fatigue. Specific form = understand needs = prepare proposal = close deal.</p>

        <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mx-auto">
          70% of sommeliers should use <span class="text-amber-300">Squarespace</span>. 20% should use <span class="text-amber-300">Webflow</span>. 7% should use <span class="text-amber-300">Framer</span>. 3% should use something else.

          <p class="text-white/90">Your Master Sommelier certification means nothing if I can't taste your expertise through your website.</p>
          <p class="text-white/90">Resume-only site = "trust me, I know wine" = restaurant owner skips to next sommelier with visible portfolio.</p>
          <p class="text-white/90">Generic tasting notes ("fruity red") = amateur communication = can't train my staff = skip. Specific notes ("black cherry, forest floor, grippy tannins") = professional = clear communicator = hire.</p>
          <p class="text-white/90">"Contact for pricing" = expensive mystery = qualified prospects inquire elsewhere. Show packages ("Wine List Development: $2,500-5,000") = qualify leads = close deals.</p>

        <div class="bg-white/10 border border-white/30 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="text-white font-black text-xl mb-3">The Reality Check:</p>
          <p class="text-amber-100 mb-4">I've seen mediocre sommeliers with great portfolios earn $4,800/month from consultations. I've seen brilliant sommeliers with resume-only sites struggle to get 2-3 clients monthly. Expertise matters—but visibility matters first. Your website IS your tasting portfolio. It works 24/7. It never sleeps. It shows your wine knowledge to restaurant owners worldwide while you're working, sleeping, or tasting.</p>
          <p class="text-amber-100 mb-4">The winning formula: 20 curated wines with detailed tasting notes, specific pricing packages ("Wine List Development: $2,500-5,000"), certification badges front-and-center, consultation form with service checkboxes, mobile-optimized portfolio. This fills calendars. Everything else is noise.</p>
          <p class="text-amber-300 font-black text-2xl mb-2">Winner: Squarespace AI (9.0)</p>
          <p class="text-amber-100 mb-4">Beautiful wine templates designed specifically for portfolios. Tasting notes formatted professionally, consultation booking, certification badges display prominently, mobile-responsive by default. Perfect for sommeliers prioritizing visual presentation and filling consultation calendar.</p>
          <p class="text-amber-100 mb-4">Runner-up: Webflow AI (8.6) for sommeliers managing large cellars needing custom wine CMS. Framer AI (8.4) for design-forward wine brands wanting modern impact. Both excellent—just different scales.</p>
          <p class="text-amber-300 font-black text-lg">Build your portfolio like your reputation depends on it. It does.</p>

          Don't show only Cabernet. Restaurant owners need variety for

          rosé, sparkling, orange, natural wine, biodynamic. Different 
          regions: California, France, Italy, Spain, Oregon, Washington.
