Brilliant attorneys with Harvard/Yale pedigrees.

Competitors charging $200-300/hour had beautiful websites with attorney profiles, case results, blog content.

      Law firms waste 28+ hours on wrong platforms—weak attorney profiles, vague practice areas, no case results. Right platform showcases lawyer expertise, explains services clearly, demonstrates track record. Best law firm platforms: FindLaw (legal-specific), Justia (SEO), WordPress (flexibility), Squarespace (professional). Choose based on: firm size (solo vs 50+ attorneys), practice areas (general vs specialized), budget ($500-$5000+ monthly). Most successful law firm websites: attorney bios prominent (education, experience, awards), practice areas specific (services explained), case results visible (settlements, verdicts), testimonials/AVVO rating, free consultation offer, location hours prominent.</p>

      Law firm websites succeed through: attorney bios prominent (education, bar admissions, experience, awards, publications), practice areas specific (services explained in plain English), case results visible (verdicts, settlements with amounts), testimonials/AVVO rating (client reviews, peer endorsements), free consultation offer (prominent CTA, form), location hours prominent (office address, phone, map), mobile optimized. Most law firm website mistakes: generic bios (no personality), vague practice areas (what do you do?), no results (why hire you?), no reviews (no trust), difficult contact (friction). Best practice: detailed bios, specific services, visible results, reviews prominent, easy consultation.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Education, experience, awards</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Feature attorney bios prominently: education (law school, year, honors), bar admissions (states admitted), experience (years practicing, cases handled), awards (Super Lawyers, Best Lawyers), publications (articles, books). Generic bio = no differentiation. Detailed bios establish authority and build trust.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: DUI attorney had generic "experienced lawyer" bio only. Low inquiries, no differentiation. Added detailed bio: "Harvard Law 2005 cum laude, admitted CA NV AZ, 5000+ DUI cases handled, Super Lawyers Rising Star 2018-2023, published 'DUI Defense Handbook' 2020". Inquiries increased 150% (authority established), average case value increased 40%.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Services explained, plain English</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Explain practice areas specifically: what you do (divorce, child custody, alimony), who you help (contested vs uncontested, high-net-worth), process (what to expect), outcomes (typical results). Vague "family law" = confusion = wrong leads. Specific services attract qualified prospects.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Family lawyer had "family law services" only. Attracted wrong leads (small claims, not family law). Added: "Contested Divorce, Child Custody Battles, High-Net-Worth Divorce ($1M+ assets), Spousal Support, Prenuptial Agreements". Targeted inquiries increased 300%, case quality improved significantly (qualified leads).</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Verdicts, settlements, amounts</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Display case results prominently: verdicts ($2.5M car accident settlement), settlements ($500K medical malpractice), case types (personal injury, employment law), outcomes (won, dismissed, reduced). No results visible = why hire you? = skepticism. Visible results prove capability and drive inquiries.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Personal injury firm had no case results. Low conversion, many "can you win my case?" questions. Added results: "Recent Verdicts: $2.5M Car Accident, $1.8M Truck Accident, $900K Slip & Fall, 50+ cases settled $500K+ in 2023". Conversion increased 120% (proof established), questions decreased 70%.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Prominent CTA, easy form</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Offer free consultation prominently: CTA button (homepage, every page), form (case type, details, contact), phone number visible, live chat option. No consultation offer = no clear next step = lost leads. Easy consultation scheduling increases conversions.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Bankruptcy attorney had "contact for consultation" only. Low conversion (5%), difficult intake process. Added: "Free Consultation" button (sticky header), simple form (case type, debt amount, phone), callback promise (respond within 2 hours). Conversion increased to 15% (200% improvement), consultation bookings tripled.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Why perfect for attorneys:</strong> Professional templates that look expensive, easy to use, built-in SSL (secure), excellent client intake forms<br/>
          <strong>AI generation:</strong> Squarespace AI - good quality<br/>
          <strong>Template quality:</strong> Excellent - professional, business-appropriate designs<br/>
          <strong>Law firm features:</strong> Attorney profiles, case results showcase, intake forms, blog<br/>

          <strong>Best for:</strong> Most law firms - professional, easy, secure, affordable
        </p>
        <div class="bg-blue-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-blue-600">
          <p class="font-bold">💡 Pro tip: Squarespace is law firm gold standard. Templates look expensive ($10K+ custom site appearance). Easy to update case results, blog, attorney profiles. SSL built-in = secure client intake forms. No code export (lock-in) but most law firms won't migrate - you'll stay because it works. Best choice for 80% of law firms.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Why great for modern firms:</strong> Best AI generation, stunning modern designs, code export freedom<br/>
          <strong>AI generation:</strong> Excellent - full site from prompt in seconds<br/>
          <strong>Template quality:</strong> Stunning - modern, clean, minimal aesthetic<br/>
          <strong>Law firm features:</strong> Custom attorney pages, case results portfolio, intake forms<br/>

          <strong>Best for:</strong> Modern, design-conscious firms wanting cutting-edge look
        </p>
        <div class="bg-indigo-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-indigo-500">
          <p class="font-bold">💡 Pro tip: Framer generates beautiful modern sites (think: startup/tech attorney, boutique firm wanting contemporary look). Code export = freedom to customize beyond platform. $15/month Pro is cheaper than Squarespace. If you want modern + flexibility, Framer wins. For traditional law firms, Squarespace still safer bet.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
          <strong>Why for design-focused firms:</strong> Ultimate customization, pixel-perfect control, unique designs<br/>
          <strong>AI generation:</strong> Basic - Webflow AI is limited<br/>
          <strong>Template quality:</strong> Excellent - professional, customizable<br/>
          <strong>Law firm features:</strong> Custom case study layouts, attorney profiles, intake forms<br/>

        <div class="bg-purple-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-purple-500">
          <p class="font-bold">💡 Pro tip: Webflow is for firms wanting custom $10K-20K website look without hiring developer. Design freedom = unlimited. But requires technical skills or hiring Webflow designer. AI generation = basic (not main selling point). Choose Webflow for design power, not AI. Squarespace/Framer easier for non-designers.</p>

          <p class="font-bold">💡 Pro tip: Mixo is great for solo attorneys or new firms who need professional site FAST (in 1 day). Design = very good but not Framer/Squarespace level.

          <p class="font-bold">💡 Pro tip: WordPress is powerful but requires maintenance (updates, security, backups). Legal-specific plugins available (attorney profiles, case results, intake forms). Only choose WordPress if you have tech-savvy staff or budget for developer. For most attorneys, Squarespace/Framer = simpler, sufficient.</p>

        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-lg">

          <p class="font-bold">💡 Intake form friction = lost clients. Every required field reduces conversion by 10%. Ask for essentials only. Get detailed case info during consultation. Goal: Get contact info, schedule consultation. Don't interrogate potential clients upfront.</p>

Squarespace = quality that converts. Framer (8/10) is close second - better AI, code export, modern aesthetic. Choose Framer if you want cutting-edge look. Webflow (8/10) for custom design (budget permitting). WordPress (7/10) only if you have technical staff. Remember: Website cost is tiny fraction of ONE retained client's fees. Invest professionally. ROI = 400-2000%. Don't cheap out.</span>
