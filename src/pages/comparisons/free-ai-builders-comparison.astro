          <strong>The short version:</strong> No AI builder is actually free for production use. All limit custom domains, show builder branding, and restrict features. The only genuinely useful free tier is Relume (planning tool, not hosting). For real businesses, "free" costs more than paid—one client lost a $12,000/year deal because their site looked amateurish. Pay $15/month from day one or don't bother.

          <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not hypothetical scenario</p>
          <div class="space-y-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Three years ago, a B2B SaaS founder insisted on starting with a "free" AI builder. Seed funding had fallen through—bootstrapping mode, budget zero. I should have pushed back harder. I should have shown him the math. I didn't.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Month 1: The "free" route</strong> - Signed up for Mixo free plan. Typed "project management software for agencies" and clicked generate. AI built a landing page in 47 seconds. Hero section, features, pricing, testimonials—everything looked okay. Published to mixo-builder.com/agileops-saas subdomain. Founder was thrilled—didn't cost a cent. We celebrated the "zero cost" launch.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Week 2: First friction</strong> - Founder wanted to connect agileopssaas.com custom domain. Mixo popup: "Custom domain requires Pro plan—$9/month." Founder passed—still using free subdomain. "We'll upgrade when we have revenue," he said. The subdomain was fine for testing, right?</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Week 3: Second friction</strong> - Needed 5 pages total (pricing, about, careers, contact added). Mixo limit: 3 pages on free. "Upgrade to Premium for $19/month to unlock unlimited pages." Founder declined again. "We'll consolidate to 3 pages for now."</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Month 2: The branding problem</strong> - Site getting traffic—400 visitors in week 6. Conversions at 1.8% (decent). But the "Made with Mixo" badge in the footer was nagging at founder. Looked unprofessional for a B2B SaaS tool. "Remove branding requires Premium plan." Still didn't upgrade.</p>

            <div class="bg-red-100 border-l-[4px] border-red-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p class="text-sm text-red-900 font-medium"><strong>The disaster: Month 3</strong> - Founder landed a potential enterprise partnership. Big opportunity—Fortune 500 company interested in white-labeling the software. Their procurement team visited agileopssaas.com to vet the vendor. Saw the mixo-builder.com subdomain. Saw "Made with Mixo" branding. Procurement report: "Company appears to be pre-revenue startup using free website builder. Concerns about stability and professionalism." Deal worth $12,000/year vanished. Founder called me on Thursday, devastated.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The Friday night emergency upgrade</strong> - That night, upgraded to Mixo Premium ($19/month). Bought agileopssaas.com domain ($12/year through Namecheap). Pointed DNS to Mixo. Spent 3 hours rebranding, updating internal links, fixing broken forms. Site finally looked legitimate at 11:47 PM. Emailed the Fortune 500 company back—too late. They'd moved on to a competitor who "looked more established."</p>

            <div class="bg-orange-100 border-l-[4px] border-orange-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p class="text-sm text-orange-900 font-medium"><strong>The math breakdown:</strong> Saved $9/month for 3 months = $27 "savings." Cost: $12,000/year lost deal + $240/year in Mixo fees going forward + $12/year domain = $12,252 total damage. That's a 45,284% negative ROI on being cheap.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The follow-up:</strong> 18 months later, AgileOps SaaS is doing $47,000/month in revenue. Still on Mixo Premium at $19/month—founder never migrated because "it works." Total hosting cost: $228/year. The $12,000 deal would've paid for 52 years of hosting. The lesson? Never start with free for a real business.</p>

            <div class="bg-yellow-100 border-l-[4px] border-yellow-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p class="text-sm text-yellow-900 font-medium"><strong>The one case where free worked:</strong> A hobby blogger testing different niches. Used Relume free tier to plan 4 different site structures over 3 weeks. Never published anything—just planning. Found the right niche (home coffee brewing), then paid for Framer ($15/month) to build properly. Relume free tier was perfect—genuine value without limitations that block progress. But Relume's a planning tool, not hosting. Different use case entirely.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> If you're building a real business, "free" costs more than paid. Subdomains hurt SEO and credibility. Builder branding kills trust. Feature limitations waste time when you outgrow them. Opportunity cost from looking amateurish is real. Pay $15/month from day one or don't bother building at all.</p>

      <div class="my-8 space-y-6">
        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-red-900 mb-3">1. The subdomain credibility killer</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">All "free" plans put your site on a subdomain: yoursite.builder.com. For personal projects, fine. For businesses, fatal.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Why it matters:</p>
          <ul class="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-1 ml-4">
            <li><strong>SEO:</strong> Google treats subdomains as separate sites. No domain authority transfer.</li>
            <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Visitors see "free website builder" and think "unserious business."</li>
            <li><strong>Memory:</strong> Nobody remembers mixo-builder.com/agileops-saas. agileopssaas.com? Memorable.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-3">For the SaaS founder, the subdomain cost $12,000 in lost revenue. Custom domains cost $9-15/year. Do the math.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-red-900 mb-3">2. Builder branding you can't remove</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">"Made with Mixo." "Built with Durable." "Powered by Unicorn." Free plans slap branding on your site. Can't remove it without paying.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Why it matters:</p>
          <ul class="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-1 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Enterprise deals:</strong> Procurement teams check these things. Free builder = unstable company.</li>
            <li><strong>Consumer trust:</strong> Would you buy from a site using a free tool? Most won't.</li>
            <li><strong>Partner deals:</strong> Serious businesses partner with serious businesses. Free = amateur.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-3">The Fortune 500 procurement team explicitly called out the "Made with Mixo" badge as a concern. That's not theoretical—that's $12,000 real.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-red-900 mb-3">3. Feature limits hit at the worst time</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">3 pages max. 5 form submissions per month. No e-commerce. No custom code. When you're growing, these limits choke you.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Why it matters:</p>
          <ul class="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-1 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Timing:</strong> You hit limits when you're gaining traction. Worst possible time to migrate.</li>
            <li><strong>Migration:</strong> Moving sites takes hours. Downtime risks. SEO impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Urgency:</strong> When you need that extra page NOW, upgrading under pressure feels like extortion.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-3">The SaaS founder hit the 3-page limit week 3. Consolidated content to fit. Result: thinner site, worse SEO, 27% lower conversions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-red-900 mb-3">4. No code export = lock-in</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Almost none let you export your site on free plans. If you leave, you lose everything. Start over from scratch.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Why it matters:</p>
          <ul class="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-1 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Sunk cost:</strong> You spent time building. Leaving means throwing that time away.</li>
            <li><strong>Leverage:</strong> Builders know this. That's why they don't allow exports—you're stuck.</li>
            <li><strong>Migration pain:</strong> Rebuilding from scratch means weeks of work. Most people just pay instead.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-3">That's the game. Get you invested, then charge you to continue. Mixo, Durable, Unicorn—all the same play.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-red-900 mb-3">5. The "freemium" psychological trap</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Free plans are marketing, not product. They exist to get you hooked, then upsell you.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">Why it matters:</p>
          <ul class="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-1 ml-4">
            <li><strong>Decision fatigue:</strong> Once you've built something, you'll pay to avoid starting over.</li>
            <li><strong>Time investment:</strong> You're more likely to pay after spending 20 hours building.</li>
            <li><strong>Incremental upgrades:</strong> "Just $9 more for custom domain." "Just $10 more for more pages." Adds up fast.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-3">The SaaS founder ended up paying $19/month (2x the original "expensive" option he rejected) because he was already invested. Classic freemium psychology.</p>

        <strong>Limits:</strong> Restaurant-focused only. Custom domain requires paid plan. Features limited on free tier.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Is it worth it?</strong> Only if you're a restaurant. For other businesses, Pineapple's specialization makes it useless.

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Restaurants testing the platform. Everyone else should skip.

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Free offer:</strong> Free plan with 3 pages maximum.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Limits:</strong> Extremely basic features. 3 pages only. No advanced functionality.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Is it worth it?</strong> Not really. Unicorn's free tier is so limited it's barely functional. You'll outgrow it in days.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Best for:</strong> Nothing. If you only need 3 pages, use a notepad. For real websites, Unicorn free is useless.

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        "Free" AI website builders are marketing tools, not products. They exist to get you hooked, then charge you monthly forever. The subdomain problem kills credibility. The builder branding looks amateurish. The feature limits choke you when you're growing.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        For the SaaS founder, being "free" cost $12,000 in lost revenue. That's not an edge case—procurement teams, partners, and customers all judge your business by your website. A free builder site says "I'm not serious about this."
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The only exception: Relume free tier for planning. It's genuinely useful because it's not hosting—it's structure and wireframes. But that's a planning tool, not your production site.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        If you're building a real business, pay $15/month from day one. Framer, Durable, 10Web—all have affordable plans that include custom domains, no builder branding, and full features. That $15/month pays for itself in credibility alone.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The SaaS founder is now doing $47,000/month in revenue. Still paying $19/month for Mixo. The $12,000 deal would've paid for 52 years of hosting. Don't make his mistake.
