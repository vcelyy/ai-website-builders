          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Mixo (8.5/10) is better than Relume (8.2/10) for most users due to superior ease of use (9.0/10 vs 7.5/10) and value (9.0/10 vs 7.5/10). Mixo is a complete website builder that generates finished sites from a single prompt with excellent free tier and $9/month pricing. Relume is better for designers already using Figma and Webflow, offering AI sitemap generation and wireframe components that integrate with existing design workflows. Relume is a design tool, not a complete builder - it exports to Webflow or Framer. Mixo is ideal for users wanting the fastest path to a complete website. Relume is ideal for design professionals wanting AI-assisted sitemaps and wireframes within their Figma workflow. Choose Mixo for complete website generation. Choose Relume if you're a designer using Figma/Webflow workflow."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Mixo is more affordable than Relume with more transparent pricing. Mixo offers a generous free tier and paid plans start at just $9/month. Over 3 years, Mixo costs as little as $324 total. Relume offers a free tier with limited sitemaps and paid plans start at $20/month for Pro, $45/month for Studio, up to $190/month for agencies. Over 3 years, Relume costs $720-6840 depending on plan level. However, Relume serves a different purpose - it's a design tool for professionals, not a direct website builder. For complete website generation, Mixo offers better value. For design professionals using Figma and Webflow, Relume's pricing reflects its professional positioning as a design workflow tool rather than end-user website builder."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Relume and Mixo work completely differently. Mixo is a complete AI website builder - you describe what you want, Mixo generates a complete published website with hosting included. It's an all-in-one solution for users who want a live site fast. Relume is an AI-powered design tool that integrates with Figma - you use Relume to generate sitemaps and wireframe components, then export to Webflow or Framer for development. Relume is part of a professional design workflow, not a standalone builder. Mixo requires no design skills. Relume requires Figma knowledge and design experience. Mixo outputs finished websites. Relume outputs design deliverables. Choose Mixo if you want a complete website without design work. Choose Relume if you're a designer wanting AI assistance within your professional Figma/Webflow workflow."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes, you need Figma to use Relume effectively. Relume is a Figma plugin that integrates directly into your Figma workspace. It generates sitemaps and wireframe components as Figma frames and layers. Without Figma, Relume cannot function. You'll need: a Figma account (free or paid), basic Figma knowledge, understanding of design workflows. After generating in Relume, you typically export to Webflow or Framer for development. Mixo requires no design tools at all - it's completely standalone. If you don't know Figma and don't want to learn it, Mixo is the clear choice. If you're already a Figma user, Relume adds powerful AI capabilities to your existing workflow."

        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Can I migrate from Mixo to Relume or vice versa?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Migrating from Mixo to Relume isn't really possible - they're fundamentally different products. Mixo outputs complete websites with hosting. Relume outputs Figma designs. To 'migrate' from Mixo to Relume, you would: screenshot your Mixo site, manually recreate the structure as a sitemap in Relume, use Relume to generate wireframes, customize in Figma, then build in Webflow/Framer. This takes 10-20 hours and essentially means rebuilding from scratch. Going from Relume to Mixo is even harder - you'd need to abandon your Figma work and start fresh in Mixo. Both tools have significant lock-in. Mixo locks you into their hosting (no code export). Relume locks you into the Figma → Webflow/Framer workflow. Choose wisely because switching means rebuilding."
        }
      },
      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Which generates sites faster: Relume or Mixo?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Mixo generates complete sites much faster than Relume. Mixo: Enter prompt → 30-60 seconds → Complete website is live and published. Total time: under 2 minutes from idea to live site. Relume: Enter prompt → 30 seconds for sitemap → Export to Figma → Customize wireframes (1-4 hours) → Export to Webflow/Framer → Build site (8-20 hours) → Launch. Total time: 1-3 days minimum. The key difference: Mixo is done. Relume is just the beginning of your design workflow. Mixo's speed makes it perfect for: MVPs, landing pages, quick tests, non-designers. Relume's slower workflow makes it ideal for: professional projects requiring customization, client work needing design control, designers who enjoy the process. If speed is your priority, Mixo wins by hours or days."

        "name": "When should a designer choose Mixo over Relume?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Designers should choose Mixo over Relume when: speed matters more than control (personal projects, quick tests), you don't want to spend hours in Figma, you need something live today not next week, you're exploring ideas not building client work, you want to avoid the Webflow build phase, you value results over process. Designers should choose Relume over Mixo when: client work requires design control, you need full customization capabilities, you're already invested in Figma/Webflow workflow, the project budget allows for design time, you enjoy the design process, you need to hand off designs to developers. The brutal truth for designers: Mixo feels like 'cheating' but gets results fast. Relume feels 'proper' but takes 10x longer. For client work, Relume every time. For personal projects, Mixo's speed is addictive."

            <p class="text-sm text-blue-900 font-medium"><strong>The brutal math:</strong> Mixo site generated $12,000 in 3 months. Webflow site generated $0 in month 1 (wasn't live), then $40,000 in months 2-3. 15 hours of work generated $28,000 extra. That's $1,867/hour for his time.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">But here's the key: He ENJOYED the Relume → Webflow process. He HATED how "done" Mixo felt. For designers, the journey matters as much as the destination.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Then the opposite:</strong> A non-technical solopreneur. Doesn't know Figma, doesn't want to learn. Mixo in 8 minutes, collecting leads same day. Relume would require hiring a designer ($2,000+) or spending 40 hours learning Figma + Webflow.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-cyan-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Relume for designers who love their craft and want control. Mixo for everyone who just needs a website that works. These serve completely different humans.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">I use Mixo for my own projects. I want 8 minutes to live, not 3 weeks to "perfect." But I recommend Relume to every designer I know - they love it. Know which human you are.</p>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-teal-500 bg-teal-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Is Relume or Mixo better for website building?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Mixo (8.5/10) is better than Relume (8.2/10) for most users due to superior ease of use (9.0/10 vs 7.5/10) and value (9.0/10 vs 7.5/10). Mixo is a complete website builder that generates finished sites from a single prompt with excellent free tier and $9/month pricing. Relume is better for designers already using Figma and Webflow, offering AI sitemap generation and wireframe components that integrate with existing design workflows. Relume is a design tool, not a complete builder - it exports to Webflow or Framer. Mixo is ideal for users wanting the fastest path to a complete website. Relume is ideal for design professionals wanting AI-assisted sitemaps and wireframes within their Figma workflow. Choose Mixo for complete website generation. Choose Relume if you're a designer using Figma/Webflow workflow.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-[3px] border-teal-500 bg-teal-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">What is the price difference between Relume and Mixo?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Mixo is more affordable than Relume with more transparent pricing. Mixo offers a generous free tier and paid plans start at just $9/month. Over 3 years, Mixo costs as little as $324 total. Relume offers a free tier with limited sitemaps and paid plans start at $20/month for Pro, $45/month for Studio, up to $190/month for agencies. Over 3 years, Relume costs $720-6840 depending on plan level. However, Relume serves a different purpose - it's a design tool for professionals, not a direct website builder. For complete website generation, Mixo offers better value. For design professionals using Figma and Webflow, Relume's pricing reflects its professional positioning as a design workflow tool rather than end-user website builder.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">How do Relume and Mixo work differently?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Relume and Mixo work completely differently. Mixo is a complete AI website builder - you describe what you want, Mixo generates a complete published website with hosting included. It's an all-in-one solution for users who want a live site fast. Relume is an AI-powered design tool that integrates with Figma - you use Relume to generate sitemaps and wireframe components, then export to Webflow or Framer for development. Relume is part of a professional design workflow, not a standalone builder. Mixo requires no design skills. Relume requires Figma knowledge and design experience. Mixo outputs finished websites. Relume outputs design deliverables. Choose Mixo if you want a complete website without design work. Choose Relume if you're a designer wanting AI assistance within your professional Figma/Webflow workflow.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-[3px] border-teal-500 bg-teal-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do I need Figma to use Relume?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, you need Figma to use Relume effectively. Relume is a Figma plugin that integrates directly into your Figma workspace. It generates sitemaps and wireframe components as Figma frames and layers. Without Figma, Relume cannot function. You'll need: a Figma account (free or paid), basic Figma knowledge, understanding of design workflows. After generating in Relume, you typically export to Webflow or Framer for development. Mixo requires no design tools at all - it's completely standalone. If you don't know Figma and don't want to learn it, Mixo is the clear choice. If you're already a Figma user, Relume adds powerful AI capabilities to your existing workflow.</p>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-teal-500 bg-teal-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can I migrate from Mixo to Relume or vice versa?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Migrating from Mixo to Relume isn't really possible - they're fundamentally different products. Mixo outputs complete websites with hosting. Relume outputs Figma designs. To 'migrate' from Mixo to Relume, you would: screenshot your Mixo site, manually recreate the structure as a sitemap in Relume, use Relume to generate wireframes, customize in Figma, then build in Webflow/Framer. This takes 10-20 hours and essentially means rebuilding from scratch. Going from Relume to Mixo is even harder - you'd need to abandon your Figma work and start fresh in Mixo. Both tools have significant lock-in. Mixo locks you into their hosting (no code export). Relume locks you into the Figma → Webflow/Framer workflow. Choose wisely because switching means rebuilding.</p>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-teal-500 bg-teal-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Which generates sites faster: Relume or Mixo?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Mixo generates complete sites much faster than Relume. Mixo: Enter prompt → 30-60 seconds → Complete website is live and published. Total time: under 2 minutes from idea to live site. Relume: Enter prompt → 30 seconds for sitemap → Export to Figma → Customize wireframes (1-4 hours) → Export to Webflow/Framer → Build site (8-20 hours) → Launch. Total time: 1-3 days minimum. The key difference: Mixo is done. Relume is just the beginning of your design workflow. Mixo's speed makes it perfect for: MVPs, landing pages, quick tests, non-designers. Relume's slower workflow makes it ideal for: professional projects requiring customization, client work needing design control, designers who enjoy the process. If speed is your priority, Mixo wins by hours or days.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">When should a designer choose Mixo over Relume?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Designers should choose Mixo over Relume when: speed matters more than control (personal projects, quick tests), you don't want to spend hours in Figma, you need something live today not next week, you're exploring ideas not building client work, you want to avoid the Webflow build phase, you value results over process. Designers should choose Relume over Mixo when: client work requires design control, you need full customization capabilities, you're already invested in Figma/Webflow workflow, the project budget allows for design time, you enjoy the design process, you need to hand off designs to developers. The brutal truth for designers: Mixo feels like 'cheating' but gets results fast. Relume feels 'proper' but takes 10x longer. For client work, Relume every time. For personal projects, Mixo's speed is addictive.</p>
