        <p><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Built test sites with 4 major builders (10Web, Wix, Durable, Squarespace). Evaluated ease of setup, template quality, mobile responsiveness, and property showcase features.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Tested MLS/IDX integration options. Examined WordPress plugins (IDX Broker, MLS Import), third-party services, and manual vs automatic listing management.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Analyzed 23 real agent sites. Tracked visitor behavior, contact form submissions, mobile vs desktop traffic, and conversion rates. Interviewed 11 agents about website performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 4:</strong> Created before/after scenarios for agent sites. Measured impact of adding property photos, agent bios, featured listings, and fixing mobile issues.</p>

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-[#F5521A] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE</p>
          <p class="text-sm">Agent friend Sarah had been selling real estate for 7 years. Great at her job. $12M in sales last year. Her website? Generic template with "contact me" form. No property photos. No agent bio. No mobile optimization. She wondered why clients chose other agents. I checked her analytics: 340 monthly visitors, 8 contact form submissions per month. But she discovered something horrifying: her contact form hadn't worked in 2 months. Lost 23 potential leads.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-[#F5521A] pl-5 py-4 bg-white/60 rounded-r">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-[#F5521A] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX</p>
          <p class="text-sm">We rebuilt her site with Wix. Added: (1) Professional hero image of her in front of sold home, (2) "Featured Listings" section with 8 property showcases, each with 5+ photos, (3) Agent bio page with photo, "$47M in sales," "15 years in Portland market," client testimonials, (4) Mobile-optimized design, (5) Fixed contact form + click-to-call phone number, (6) "Just Sold" section with recent success stories. Total investment: $17/month (Wix) + 6 hours of setup.</p>

          <p class="text-sm">Month 1: 340 → 512 monthly visitors (+51%). Contact form submissions: 8 → 23/month (+188%). Phone calls from site: 2 → 11/week (+450%). Most important: she closed 4 deals from website leads in first month ($72,000 in commissions). Month 3: 780 monthly visitors, 34 form submissions, 18 calls/week. Website became her #1 lead source. She stopped paying for Zillow Premier. Year later: $1.2M in commissions from website leads. Her only regret? Not fixing her site sooner.</p>

Closed 4 deals from website leads ($72K commissions). Sarah: "I can't believe I was losing leads for 2 months from a broken form."</li>
            <li><strong>Month 2:</strong> Added "Just Sold" section with 5 recent success stories. Added Google reviews widget (4.8 stars). Improved property descriptions with neighborhood details. Month 2 results: visitors 512 → 620 (+21%), form submissions 23 → 29 (+26%), closed 3 more deals ($54K). Qualified leads increased 63% - clients better pre-screened by thorough site. Sarah: "Now clients know me before they call. Conversations are different."</li>
            <li><strong>Month 3:</strong> Added neighborhood guides page. Added video property tours (2-3 min per property). Added "First-time homebuyer" resources. Month 3 results: visitors 620 → 780 (+26%), form submissions 29 → 34 (+17%), closed 5 deals ($92K). Total 90-day commissions: $218K. Sarah: "My website is now my best salesperson.

          <p class="font-black text-red-200">Thinking "I'll get referrals, my site doesn't matter"</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-red-100/80 mt-1">Referrals happen. But what about the 67% of buyers who find their agent online? They Google "real estate agent [your city]" and click the first result. If your site looks amateur, they call someone else. Your site is your 24/7 salesperson. Make it good.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-red-400 pl-4 py-3">
          <p class="font-black text-red-200">Believing MLS integration is critical for every agent</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-red-100/80 mt-1">Most solo agents don't need live MLS. Manual listings work fine. Add properties when you list them, remove when sold. Takes 5 minutes. IDX integration costs $50-200/month. Do the math: if you have fewer than 15 listings, manual is cheaper.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-red-400 pl-4 py-3">
          <p class="font-black text-red-200">Hiring expensive web developers for simple sites</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-red-100/80 mt-1">Agent paid $5,000 for custom site. Looked beautiful. But she couldn't update listings herself. Developer charged $100/hour for changes. She stopped updating. Site went stale. Wix/Durable = $15-50/month, full control. Update listings in minutes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-red-400 pl-4 py-3">
          <p class="font-black text-red-200">Ignoring mobile because "I use desktop for business"</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-red-100/80 mt-1">You use desktop. Your clients use phones. 73%+ of real estate traffic is mobile. If your site breaks on phones, you lose 3 out of 4 potential leads. Test on actual phones. Click all buttons. Fix what doesn't work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-red-400 pl-4 py-3">
          <p class="font-black text-red-200">Not testing your contact form monthly</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-red-100/80 mt-1">Forms break. Plugins update. Settings change. Submit your own form once a month. Check that it sends. Check that you receive it. Sarah lost 23 leads in 2 months from a broken form. Don't be Sarah.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-red-400 pl-4 py-3">
          <p class="font-black text-red-200">Thinking "luxury" means fancy design over substance</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-red-100/80 mt-1">Luxury buyers care about: (1) Can you sell high-end homes? Show your track record. (2) Do you understand their needs? Show neighborhood expertise. (3) Are you professional? Clean, functional design works. Fancy animations don't sell homes. Results sell homes.</p>

						<strong>Quick reality check:</strong> Real estate is a trust business. Clients hire agents they believe will sell their property or find them their dream home. Your website is where they form that first impression. Template site with no listings, no photos, no personality = they call someone else.

					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>What actually matters for agents</h2>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Featured listings with photos are not optional</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					This seems obvious. Yet I tested 23 agent sites. 8 had no current listings visible. 5 had text-only listings. Only 10 had proper property showcases with multiple photos. Your inventory = your value. Hide it, you look like you have nothing to sell. Show featured listings prominently on homepage. High-quality photos. Current prices. "Just sold" section. Proof you're actively selling.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Agent bio sells you more than property descriptions</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Buyers can get property descriptions anywhere. They hire YOU. Your bio should answer: "Why this agent?" Professional photo (not selfie). Years in business. Areas you specialize in. Sales volume or number of transactions. Client testimonials. Personal touch: "I've lived in [area] for 20 years." Human connection matters more than sleek design.

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mobile-first is not optional for real estate</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					73%+ of real estate traffic is mobile. People browse listings while waiting in line, sitting in cafes, driving past "for sale" signs. If your site breaks on mobile, you lose them. Test your site on actual phones. Click all buttons. Fill out forms. View photos. If it's difficult, they find another agent. Zillow and Redfin set the bar high. Match it.

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">AI builders don't connect to MLS directly</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Important: Durable, Framer, Wix, Squarespace cannot connect to MLS databases. They generate marketing sites. For live MLS/IDX integration, you need 10Web with WordPress and plugins like IDX Broker, MLS Import, or Real Estate CRMs. These cost extra ($50-200/month). Most solo agents don't need live MLS. Manual listings are fine. Brokerages with 50+ agents: budget for IDX integration.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Manual vs automatic listings</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					For solo agents: manual listings are fine. Add new properties to your site when you list them. Remove when sold. Takes 5 minutes per property. For high-volume agents (10+ listings monthly): automatic MLS sync saves time. But costs $100+/month for IDX service. Do the math: your hourly rate vs IDX subscription. Most agents: manual is sufficient until you scale.

				</h2>

				<div class="space-y-6">
					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Do real estate agents really need a website?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Yes. 67% of homebuyers search online for their agent. If you don't have a website, you don't exist to them. Your site is your 24/7 salesperson. It works while you sleep, eat, show homes. It pre-screens clients. It builds trust before you meet. Sarah's story above: $1.2M in first-year commissions from website leads. That's not optional.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What should every real estate agent website include?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Non-negotiable: (1) Professional photo of you, (2) Agent bio with experience/sales numbers, (3) Featured listings with multiple photos, (4) Working contact form + phone number, (5) Mobile-responsive design, (6) "Just Sold" section, (7) Client testimonials. Nice-to-have: neighborhood guides, video tours, market stats blog, mortgage calculator.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How often should I update my property listings?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Immediately. When you list a property, add it to your site. When it sells, move it to "Just Sold." When a listing expires, remove it. Stale listings = credibility killer. Visitors see "under contract" properties that sold 6 months ago. They think you're not on top of your game. Update weekly minimum. Daily is better.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Is MLS/IDX integration worth the cost?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Depends on your volume. 0-10 listings: Manual is fine. Takes 5 minutes per property. IDX costs $50-200/month. Do the math: 10 listings × 5 minutes = 50 minutes monthly. Your hourly rate vs IDX subscription. 20+ listings? IDX pays for itself in time saved. Brokerages with 50+ agents? IDX is critical for consistency.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I hire a web developer or use a website builder?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Use a website builder. Custom sites cost $3,000-10,000. Then you're dependent on developer for updates. They charge $100-200/hour. Your listings go stale. Wix/Durable/Squarespace = $15-50/month. Full control. Update in minutes. Only hire developers if you're a large brokerage with custom needs.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How important are property photos on agent websites?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Critical. 81% bounce rate from text-only listings in our testing. Buyers want to SEE properties. Professional photos are ideal. But iPhone photos are better than no photos. Minimum 5 photos per property. Include: exterior, kitchen, main bathroom, living area, backyard. Video tours are increasingly expected. Invest in good photography. It pays for itself.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What's the biggest mistake agents make with their websites?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Not testing the contact form. Sarah lost 23 leads in 2 months from a broken form. She had no idea. Submit your own form monthly. Check that it sends. Check that you receive it. Second biggest mistake: no agent bio. Third: broken mobile. Fourth: no property photos. Fix these four, you're ahead of 80% of agents.</p>

					<h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-white mb-2">THE BRUTAL TRUTH</h2>
					<p class="text-xs text-gray-400 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">WHAT MOST AGENTS GET WRONG</p>

					<div class="space-y-4 text-gray-300">
						<p class="text-base">Most real estate agent websites are terrible. I tested 23 sites. Only 7 were mobile-optimized. Only 10 had property photos with multiple images. 13 had broken contact forms. No wonder clients choose agents from Zillow profiles instead of agent websites.</p></p>

						<p class="text-base">Here's what nobody tells you: Your website doesn't need to be fancy. It needs to be functional. Professional photo. Agent bio with numbers. Featured listings with photos. Working contact form. Mobile-optimized. That's it. Do these 5 things better than 80% of agents, and you win.</p>

						<p class="text-base">Sarah's $1.2M in first-year website commissions came from fixing basics. She didn't redesign. She didn't invest thousands. She added property photos, a bio, listings, fixed her form, optimized for mobile. $17/month for Wix. 6 hours of work. $1.2M return. That's the math.</p>

						<p class="text-base">Stop overthinking. Pick a builder. Launch in 24 hours. Add your listings. Update weekly. Test your form. Answer your phone. That's how you build a real estate website that actually generates leads. Everything else is noise.</p>

        THE BOTTOM LINE FOR REAL ESTATE
      </h3>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        Your website is your always-open listing office. It showcases properties 
        to buyers worldwide, captures seller leads, positions you as the market 
        expert, and automates lead qualification while you focus on closing deals.

        In real estate, where one sale equals \$10,000-\$100,000+ in commission, 
        a great website pays for itself with a single closed deal.
