        <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Why Pineapple's Obsession With Restaurants Works</h2>
        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">When being too narrow is just right</p>

        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            I tested Pineapple Builder with skepticism. "A website builder ONLY for restaurants? That's too narrow. What if I want to expand?" Classic tech founder thinking - optimize for flexibility, not focus.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Then I talked to a restaurant owner using Pineapple. She showed me her old Squarespace site - generic template, manual menu updates, broken integration with OpenTable. 3 hours per week managing the website.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-yellow-100 border-l-[4px] border-yellow-600 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-yellow-900 font-medium">
              <strong>The switch:</strong> Moved to Pineapple. Menu updates sync with POS. Reservations feed directly to OpenTable. Delivery orders route to UberEats/DoorDash automatically. 15 minutes per week now.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>The insight:</strong> Restaurant owners don't CARE about website flexibility. They care about not having to think about their website. Pineapple connects all the restaurant systems so they don't have to.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-amber-100 border-l-[4px] border-amber-600 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-amber-900 font-medium">
              <strong>The tradeoff:</strong> Your site will look like other restaurant sites. The templates are basic. But your competitors are struggling with manual updates while yours just works.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Who is Pineapple actually for?</strong> Restaurants, cafes, food trucks, bakeries - anyone in food service who wants their website to just work.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Who should skip it?</strong> Anyone not in food service. This tool is USELESS if you're not selling food. And that's okay.

            <strong>1. This is ONLY for restaurants.</strong> If you're a consultant, designer, agency, retail store - skip it. Pineapple has zero features for non-food businesses.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>2. Design customization is limited.</strong> You're picking templates, not building custom designs. If you need a unique visual brand, look elsewhere.

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>3. Value comes from integrations, not design.</strong> The magic is POS sync, reservation systems, delivery platforms. If you don't need those, you're paying for features you won't use.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>4. No code export means lock-in.</strong> But at $5/mo, switching costs are low. If you outgrow Pineapple, migrating to Squarespace or Wix is manageable.
