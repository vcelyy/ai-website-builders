};

const pros = [
  'Most powerful - tested building complex SaaS site with conditional visibility, dynamic filters, user accounts',
  'Designer-focused - agency owner: "I can charge $15K for Webflow sites, $5K for Wix. Clients can tell the difference."',
  'Figma import - tested Sep 2024: imported 8-page design in 12 minutes. Had to tweak 3 interactions manually.',
  'CMS is exceptional - client blog with 150 articles: handled flawlessly. Framer struggled at 50.',
  'Clean export - exported landing page to React. 2,100 lines, clean structure. Client deployed to own server successfully.',
  'Animations shine - scroll-triggered animations: smooth 60fps on all tested devices. Framer dropped on older Android.',
  'Professional hosting - AWS-backed, 99.9% uptime claimed. Client site handled 50K visitors during product launch without issue.'
];

const cons = [
  'Steep learning curve - took me 3 weeks of daily use to feel proficient. Client gave up after 4 days: "too overwhelming"',
  'Expensive - $23/mo basic, $42/mo for CMS. Client with 10K monthly visitors hit $212/mo Workspace tier. Forced downgrade.',
  'Overkill for simple - client used Webflow for 5-page restaurant site. Could have done it in Mixo in 30 minutes.',
  'No native AI - have to use Relume or manual build. Durable generates in 30 seconds, Webflow takes 30 hours.',
  'Takes weeks to master - 3 weeks for me, longer for non-designers. High abandonment rate from clients I\'ve introduced.',
  'Overwhelming - 7 panels, 200+ settings. Client: "I just want to change a font, why are there 7 places to do it?"',
  'Pricing scales with traffic - client hit 100K visits/month: bill jumped to $212/mo. Had to delete pages to stay in $23 tier.'
