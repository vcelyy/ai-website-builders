          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Jennifer Walsh runs Walsh Estate Planning in San Diego. 12 years experience, boutique practice, excellent client care. Website: generic law firm template, "estate planning services" vague, process not explained, credentials buried in footer, consultation form difficult to find. Result: 22 inquiries/month, $38,000 revenue, mostly referrals. Problem: families planning estates search online = never find Walsh. Competitors with clear services and process get the calls. Walsh: "I'm great at what I do, but families don't know I exist. My website looks like every other law firm - no personality, no clarity."</p>

Total investment: $4,200 (Webflow subscription 1 year + designer). Build time: 5 days. Walsh: "I focused on clarity and trust building. Families are nervous about estate planning - they need comfort and confidence."</p>

Process visible: comfort = trust = hire. Credentials prominent: qualified = safe = choose over competitor. Testimonials front and center: social proof = others trusted her = I trust her. Free consultation: risk-free = book now instead of delaying. Mobile booking: family discussion = search together = book immediately. Walsh: "Clear website = legitimate practice = trust = inquiries.

          <p class="text-gray-700">Site lists "estate planning" without specifics. Family searching "living trust attorney" - does Walsh do that? Unclear = they call competitor. Fix: List services explicitly: "Living Trusts, Last Will & Testament, Power of Attorney, Healthcare Directives, Trust Administration." Specific services = they call you for their need.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Attorney has no visible process. Family: "what happens when I hire you?" Unclear = anxiety = call competitor with clear steps. Fix: Add "Step 1: Free Consultation, Step 2: Custom Plan, Step 3: Draft Documents, Step 4: Signing & Funding" prominently. Process visible = comfort = trust = hire.</p>

      Estate planning attorneys waste 20+ hours on wrong platforms—weak credential display, no service clarity, poor consultation booking. Right platform builds confidence immediately, showcases expertise clearly, enables easy consultation scheduling. Best estate planning attorney platforms: Squarespace (professional templates), WordPress + plugins (booking systems, legal resources), LawLytics (legal-specific), Avvo (built-in client network). Choose based on: practice size (solo vs firm), marketing strategy, consultation volume. Most successful estate planning attorney websites: credentials prominent, services specific (wills, trusts, probate), consultation booking easy, testimonials with asset protection outcomes, pricing transparent, educational resources valuable.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Credibility, clean design</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Squarespace: professional templates with attorney bio layouts, service displays, consultation forms. For estate planning attorneys prioritizing straightforward credibility presentation—Squarespace delivers professional results fast. Credentials, services, testimonials, consultation booking—launched in weekend. Less legal-specific functionality, sufficient for many attorneys.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Estate planning attorney used Squarespace: credentials (bar admissions, certifications), services (wills, trusts, probate), consultation booking (online scheduling), testimonials. Consultation bookings increased 70% (professional presentation), justified $300-600/hour rates, built $450k annual revenue.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">WordPress + plugins: legal blog (estate planning tips, tax updates), booking plugins (consultation scheduling), legal resource libraries. Plugin ecosystem adds legal functionality fast. For attorneys prioritizing content marketing—WordPress superior blogging and SEO. Trade-off: maintenance, security updates.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Estate planning firm used WordPress with legal blog: articles (estate tax updates, trust strategies), lead magnet (\"Estate Planning Checklist\" PDF), consultation scheduling.

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Estate planning firm used LawLytics: attorney profiles (credentials, specializations), case results (anonymous), ethical marketing (bar-compliant).

Optimized profile with: services, credentials, reviews, pricing. 10M+ monthly visitors, potential clients active daily. For attorneys relying on referrals and directories—optimized Avvo profile may suffice before investing in website.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Estate planning attorney used only Avvo for 18 months: optimized profile with services, credentials, reviews, consultation pricing ($350).

      Estate planning attorney websites succeed through: credentials prominent (bar admissions, certifications, experience), services specific (wills, trusts, probate, asset protection), consultation booking easy (online scheduling, phone prominent), testimonials with asset protection outcomes (specific results, tax savings), pricing transparent (consultation fees, estate plan ranges), educational resources valuable (blog, guides, checklists), contact accessible. Most estate planning website mistakes: buried credentials (why trust you?), vague services (what do you do?), difficult consultation booking (friction loses clients), hidden pricing (wastes time). Best practice: credentials above fold, services specific, consultation one-click, pricing transparent.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Bar admissions, certifications, experience</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Display credentials prominently: State Bar Admissions, Board Certifications (Estate Planning, Trust Law), LL.M. in Taxation, Years of Experience (\"15+ years practicing estate law\"). Homepage header with credentials builds instant trust. Buried credentials in About page lose clients—legal decisions require confidence in attorney qualifications.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Attorney buried credentials in About page (hard to find). Low consultation bookings. Moved State Bar, Board Certification, \"15+ years estate planning\" to homepage header. Consultation bookings increased 80% (qualifications visible immediately), justified $400/hour premium pricing, client trust scores increased 50%.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Define services specifically: \"Revocable Living Trusts\" (not \"estate planning\"), \"Probate Administration\" (not \"legal services\"), \"Asset Protection Strategies\" (not \"wealth management\"). Vague \"estate planning services\" attracts everyone, converts no one. Specific services attract qualified prospects with defined needs.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Attorney listed \"estate planning\" only. Attracted wrong-fit prospects (DIY will questions, small estates). Changed to \"Living Trusts $2k-5k\", \"Probate Administration\", \"Asset Protection for High-Net-Worth\". Targeted inquiries increased 250%, average estate plan value doubled, client quality improved significantly.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Online scheduling, phone prominent</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Consultation booking must be frictionless: \"Book Consultation\" button homepage header, online scheduling (Calendly, Acuity), phone number prominent (clickable on mobile). Many clients prefer online booking—no phone tag required. Complex booking processes lose clients to competitors with easier scheduling.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Attorney required phone calls only for consultations (no online booking). Lost busy clients to competitors with online scheduling. Added \"Book Consultation\" button with Calendly integration. Online bookings increased 200% (convenience), consultation bookings increased 60% (easy access), after-hours bookings captured 25% more clients.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Display testimonials with specifics: \"Trust protected $2M in assets from creditors\", \"Estate plan saved $150k in taxes\", \"Probate avoided, family inherited in weeks not months\". Specific outcomes better than generic \"great attorney\". Estate planning clients want results—testimonials with asset protection and tax savings demonstrate value.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Attorney had generic testimonials (\"knowledgeable, professional\"). Low trust for $3000+ estate plans. Added specific testimonials: \"Living trust saved family $200k in estate taxes\", \"Asset protection strategy shielded business from divorce\". Conversion rate increased 120% (specific proof demonstrated value), price objections decreased 60%.</p>
