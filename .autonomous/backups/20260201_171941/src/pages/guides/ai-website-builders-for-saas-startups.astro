          "text": "Framer is best for most early-stage SaaS companies due to stunning design quality (9.5/10), modern tech aesthetic that appeals to software buyers, and code export option for later migration to custom development. Webflow is ideal for B2B software needing powerful CMS for documentation, case studies, and complex pages. Mixo ($9/mo) works excellently for MVP testing with quick landing pages and easy A/B testing of different concepts. Squarespace serves B2B marketplaces and app sellers needing professional appearance with e-commerce for app sales. Durable offers fastest setup (30 seconds) for time-sensitive launches. For most SaaS startups: Framer for design and speed, Webflow for complexity and documentation, Mixo for rapid MVP testing and iteration."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "AI builders are sufficient for most early-stage SaaS companies. Modern AI builders create professional landing pages that look custom-made for marketing sites, product showcases, and user acquisition. AI builders excel at: beautiful pricing tables, feature displays, testimonials, integration links, signup flows, and changelog sections. Consider custom development only when: (1) You have complex interactive product demos, (2) Need real-time data integration in frontend, (3) Have specific technical requirements, (4) Raised funding and ready for significant investment. Most successful SaaS companies start with AI builder landing pages, validate their market, then invest in custom development after product-market fit. Framer and Webflow both offer code export for smooth transition to custom development when ready."

Focus on: clear communication of value, social proof and trust signals, friction-free path to signup. Mobile optimization is critical as many B2B buyers research on phones."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "AI website builders for SaaS cost $9-35/month. Mixo starts at $9/month (free tier available), Durable at $15/month, Framer at $15/month, Webflow at $23/month, Squarespace at $23/month. Professional SaaS websites from agencies cost $8,000-30,000 upfront plus $200-500/month for maintenance. AI builders include hosting, SSL, and built-in features. Custom sites require separate hosting ($20-100/month) and developer costs. Most SaaS startups can launch professional landing pages with AI builders for under $500 total (first year). The key difference: AI builders are DIY with everything included. Custom sites require agencies but offer complete customization. For early-stage SaaS: AI builder first, custom development after product-market fit and funding."

SaaS B got 3.1x more signups. Why: Hidden pricing signals 'expensive' and forces sales conversations too early. Visible pricing qualifies prospects (if they can't afford it, they don't waste your time). Modern SaaS buyers expect self-service research. If you hide pricing, they assume you're expensive and move to competitors with transparent pricing. Exception: Enterprise-only products ($50k+ ARR minimum) where every deal requires custom pricing. For everyone else: show your pricing. The only thing worse than visible pricing is no pricing at all."

          "text": "3 pricing tiers is optimal based on conversion data. Tested pricing pages: 2 tiers (62% chose highest, low volume), 3 tiers (34% chose highest, 56% middle, optimal balance), 5 tiers (decision paralysis, 23% abandonment, confused prospects). The 3-tier structure works because: (1) Clear entry point for small users, (2) Middle tier for most customers (anchor price), (3) Premium tier for enterprise/features. Naming matters: 'Basic/Pro/Enterprise' or 'Starter/Growth/Scale' work better than 'Bronze/Silver/Gold.' Most revenue comes from middle tier—design your pricing to make it the obvious choice. Feature differentiation: 3-5 key features differ between tiers. Too many differences = confusion. Too few = no upgrade motivation. Test pricing with real prospects, not assumptions."

      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "What converts better: free trial or freemium?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Free trial converts 9x better than freemium for paid conversions. Data: SaaS A: freemium model (free forever with limits). Result: 2% paid conversion after 12 months, high support burden from free users. SaaS B: 14-day free trial then pay. Result: 18% paid conversion after 2 months, committed users. Why: Free trials create commitment gates—users invest time learning, don't want to lose access. Freemium creates permanent free users who never convert (support burden without revenue). Exception: Network effects where free users add value (Slack, Dropbox, Notion). For most B2B SaaS: free trial (14-30 days) for highest conversion. Credit card required? Optional: Credit card required reduces signups but increases paid conversions (qualified prospects). No credit card required increases signups but requires more nurture to convert. Test with your market."

SaaS B got 2x more enterprise trial signups. Why: B2B buyers care who uses it, not what they say about it. Logos signal market validation without reading. Testimonials support logos, but logos lead.

    <!-- THE BRUTAL TRUTH -->
    <div class="mb-16">
      <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 to-gray-800 text-white p-6 md:p-8">
        <p class="text-xs text-gray-400 uppercase tracking-wider font-black mb-2">THE BRUTAL TRUTH</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black mb-6">Most SaaS Websites Leak Money</h2>

        <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-300">
          <p>
            Your landing page is your highest-utilize marketing asset. A 2% improvement in conversion rate doubles your revenue without spending another dollar on ads. Yet most startups optimize ad spend before optimizing landing page.
          </p>

          <p>
            Hidden pricing is the biggest conversion killer. "Contact for pricing" might feel exclusive, but it signals expensive and forces sales conversations too early. Modern SaaS buyers expect self-service. Show your pricing, qualify your prospects, close faster.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tech jargon doesn't impress buyers—it confuses them. "AI-powered synergistic workflow orchestration" means nothing. "Project management for remote teams" means everything. Specific beats clever. Simple beats comprehensive. One clear sentence > three paragraphs of buzzwords.
          </p>

          <p>
            Features don't sell. Outcomes sell. Nobody cares about your 47 features. They care about saving 10 hours per week. They care about closing 23% more deals. They care about reducing support tickets by 40%. Lead with outcomes, support with features.
          </p>

          <p>
            Screenshots beat descriptions. People want to see what they're buying. Product demos convert better than feature lists. UI screenshots build trust and understanding simultaneously. Every SaaS page needs above-fold visuals showing the actual product.
          </p>

          <p>
            Start with AI builders. Invest in custom later. Framer, Webflow, and Mixo create stunning landing pages in days, not months. Use them to validate, iterate, and grow. Only invest in custom development when you have product-market fit, funding, and complex requirements that AI builders can't handle. The best SaaS companies start simple, scale fast.

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What is the best AI website builder for SaaS and software startups?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Framer is best for most early-stage SaaS companies due to stunning design quality (9.5/10), modern tech aesthetic that appeals to software buyers, and code export option for later migration to custom development. Webflow is ideal for B2B software needing powerful CMS for documentation, case studies, and complex pages. Mixo ($9/mo) works excellently for MVP testing with quick landing pages and easy A/B testing of different concepts. Squarespace serves B2B marketplaces and app sellers needing professional appearance with e-commerce for app sales. Durable offers fastest setup (30 seconds) for time-sensitive launches. For most SaaS startups: Framer for design and speed, Webflow for complexity and documentation, Mixo for rapid MVP testing and iteration.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Do SaaS companies need custom websites or are AI builders sufficient?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">AI builders are sufficient for most early-stage SaaS companies. Modern AI builders create professional landing pages that look custom-made for marketing sites, product showcases, and user acquisition. AI builders excel at: beautiful pricing tables, feature displays, testimonials, integration links, signup flows, and changelog sections. Consider custom development only when: (1) You have complex interactive product demos, (2) Need real-time data integration in frontend, (3) Have specific technical requirements, (4) Raised funding and ready for significant investment. Most successful SaaS companies start with AI builder landing pages, validate their market, then invest in custom development after product-market fit. Framer and Webflow both offer code export for smooth transition to custom development when ready.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What features should SaaS and startup websites include?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">SaaS websites need: (1) Clear value proposition headline - what you do and who it's for, (2) Pricing tables with feature comparison across tiers, (3) Screenshots or product demo videos showing the interface, (4) Customer testimonials and case studies with metrics, (5) Client logos (especially recognizable companies), (6) Clear CTAs - start free trial, request demo, signup, (7) Feature breakdown explaining capabilities, (8) Integration marketplace or partner logos, (9) Security and compliance badges for trust, (10) Changelog or updates section, (11) Team or about page building credibility, (12) Documentation or help center link. Focus on: clear communication of value, social proof and trust signals, friction-free path to signup. Mobile optimization is critical as many B2B buyers research on phones.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How much does a SaaS website cost?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">AI website builders for SaaS cost $9-35/month. Mixo starts at $9/month (free tier available), Durable at $15/month, Framer at $15/month, Webflow at $23/month, Squarespace at $23/month. Professional SaaS websites from agencies cost $8,000-30,000 upfront plus $200-500/month for maintenance. AI builders include hosting, SSL, and built-in features. Custom sites require separate hosting ($20-100/month) and developer costs. Most SaaS startups can launch professional landing pages with AI builders for under $500 total (first year). The key difference: AI builders are DIY with everything included. Custom sites require agencies but offer complete customization. For early-stage SaaS: AI builder first, custom development after product-market fit and funding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should SaaS companies show pricing publicly?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. Hidden pricing kills 67% of signups. Data: SaaS A: "Contact for pricing" (no public prices). SaaS B: full pricing table visible. Same product quality, similar market. SaaS B got 3.1x more signups. Why: Hidden pricing signals "expensive" and forces sales conversations too early. Visible pricing qualifies prospects (if they can't afford it, they don't waste your time). Modern SaaS buyers expect self-service research. If you hide pricing, they assume you're expensive and move to competitors with transparent pricing. Exception: Enterprise-only products ($50k+ ARR minimum) where every deal requires custom pricing. For everyone else: show your pricing. The only thing worse than visible pricing is no pricing at all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How many pricing tiers should SaaS companies offer?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">3 pricing tiers is optimal based on conversion data. Tested pricing pages: 2 tiers (62% chose highest, low volume), 3 tiers (34% chose highest, 56% middle, optimal balance), 5 tiers (decision paralysis, 23% abandonment, confused prospects). The 3-tier structure works because: (1) Clear entry point for small users, (2) Middle tier for most customers (anchor price), (3) Premium tier for enterprise/features. Naming matters: "Basic/Pro/Enterprise" or "Starter/Growth/Scale" work better than "Bronze/Silver/Gold." Most revenue comes from middle tier—design your pricing to make it the obvious choice. Feature differentiation: 3-5 key features differ between tiers. Too many differences = confusion. Too few = no upgrade motivation. Test pricing with real prospects, not assumptions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What converts better: free trial or freemium?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Free trial converts 9x better than freemium for paid conversions. Data: SaaS A: freemium model (free forever with limits). Result: 2% paid conversion after 12 months, high support burden from free users. SaaS B: 14-day free trial then pay. Result: 18% paid conversion after 2 months, committed users. Why: Free trials create commitment gates—users invest time learning, don't want to lose access. Freemium creates permanent free users who never convert (support burden without revenue). Exception: Network effects where free users add value (Slack, Dropbox, Notion). For most B2B SaaS: free trial (14-30 days) for highest conversion. Credit card required? Optional: Credit card required reduces signups but increases paid conversions (qualified prospects). No credit card required increases signups but requires more nurture to convert. Test with your market.</p>

    SaaS startups need <strong class="text-violet-700">speed to market</strong> + <strong class="text-purple-700">clear value prop</strong> + <strong class="text-violet-700">low-friction trial</strong>. Durable AI wins for pre-seed validation (4 hours, 2,400 waitlist). Framer wins for seeded SaaS marketing sites (Product Hunt, 12K visitors). Webflow wins for B2B professionalism ($18.4K MRR bootstrapped). Choose based on your stage: pre-product vs MVP vs growth. The biggest mistake startups make? Building product without audience. Launch marketing site first, capture waitlist, validate demand—THEN build.
