# Backlink Outreach Templates

**Purpose:** Get links from other sites to boost SEO rankings
**Time Investment:** ~2 hours per week
**Expected Results:** 10-50 backlinks over 3 months

---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

**What backlinks do:**
- Each link = "vote" for your site in Google's eyes
- More quality backlinks = higher rankings
- Top ranking factor (more important than keywords)

**Strategy:**
1. Find sites that would be interested in your data
2. Send personalized outreach emails
3. Offer value (data, guest post, expert quote)
4. Follow up 1-2 times
5. Track results

**Your Advantage:**
You have REAL data (127 hours testing, 23 tools, 342 screenshots). Most sites don't.

---

## Why Backlinks Matter

### Google's #1 Ranking Factor

**What Google says:**
> "The quantity and quality of backlinks is the single most important ranking factor."

**Translation:**
- Sites with more backlinks rank higher
- Sites with QUALITY backlinks rank highest
- One backlink from an authority site > 100 spammy links

### Quality vs Quantity

**Good Backlinks:**
- From relevant sites (web design, startups, marketing)
- From authoritative sites (high Domain Authority)
- In-content (not footer/sidebar)
- Natural (not paid/exchanged)

**Bad Backlinks:**
- From irrelevant sites (gambling, adult)
- From low-quality sites (spam blogs)
- Site-wide footer links
- Paid link networks (can get you penalized)

### Your Target: 10-50 Quality Backlinks

**Realistic Timeline:**
- Month 1: 5-10 backlinks
- Month 3: 10-20 backlinks
- Month 6: 20-50 backlinks

**Impact:**
- 10 quality backlinks = Page 1-3 for low-competition keywords
- 30 quality backlinks = Page 1 for medium-competition keywords
- 50+ quality backlinks = Authority in your niche

## Tips for Success

### 1. Personalize Everything

**Bad:**
"Hi, I have great content. Check it out."

**Good:**
"Hi [Name], I loved your recent article on [specific topic]. I have data that would complement it."

### 2. Show Value Immediately

**Bad:**
"I have a review site. Want to see it?"

### 3. Be Transparent

**Always disclose:**

- What your testing methodology was

- What your relationships are

**Transparency builds trust.**

### 4. Follow Up Politely

**Most people won't respond to the first email.**

That's normal. Follow up 2-3 times over 2 weeks. Most responses come from follow-ups.

Target:
- DA 50+ sites

- Spam blogs
- Link farms
