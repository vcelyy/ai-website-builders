# Framer AI Review: The Designer's Secret Weapon (But Not For Everyone)

**Quick verdict:** Framer is the prettiest website builder I've ever used. It's also the most frustrating if you're trying to build anything more complex than a portfolio. Designers will fall in love. SEOs will cry.

I spent 6 weeks and built 8 websites with Framer. Three were client projects. Two were landing pages that shipped in under 2 hours each. One was a personal portfolio that made my designer friends genuinely jealous.

Then there were the two I abandoned halfway through because Framer simply couldn't do what I needed.

Here's the unfiltered truth about Framer AI—the good, the bad, and the stuff their marketing team hopes you won't discover until after you've paid.

## The Good (Why Designers Obsess Over This)

### 1. The Interface is Legitimately Beautiful

I've used Figma for years. Framer feels like coming home.

The canvas-based editing, the property panels, the way you drag elements around—it's all familiar if you've ever done professional design work. My first site took 40 minutes. By site #8, I was shipping landing pages in 90 minutes flat.

No other builder comes close to this experience. Wix feels like using Microsoft Word. Webflow feels like coding with extra steps. Framer feels like designing.

### 2. Animations That Actually Work

Every other builder claims to have "smooth animations." Most deliver choppy garbage that screams "I used a website builder."

Framer's animations? They're Apple-level smooth.

I built a portfolio with scroll-triggered reveals, hover states that respond in milliseconds, and page transitions that make visitors do a double-take. Zero code. Zero headache. Just drag, set timing curves, and ship.

My client for that project sent me a text at 11 PM: "How did you make it feel so premium?"

Framer. That's how.

### 3. AI That Gets Out of Your Way

Framer's AI doesn't pretend to build your entire site. It generates layouts, suggests sections, and helps with copy. Then it steps back and lets you work.

This is the right approach. I tested Durable (generates a whole site in 30 seconds) and the results looked like... a 30-second effort. Generic. Lifeless.

Framer's AI gives you a 30% head start. The remaining 70% is where the magic happens—and Framer's design tools are built for exactly that.

### 4. Templates That Don't Suck

Most template libraries are 80% garbage, 15% acceptable, 5% actually good.

Framer flips this ratio. I'd estimate 60% of their templates are genuinely impressive. Another 30% are solid starting points. Only 10% feel like filler.

The marketplace designers who build these clearly give a damn. It shows.

## The Bad (Why I Almost Threw My Laptop)

### 1. SEO is an Afterthought

I need to be very clear about this: **Framer is not built for SEO.**

Site #4 was supposed to be a content site targeting "best AI tools for small business." I spent 3 weeks building it, wrote 15 articles, set up the CMS, and connected my domain.

Six months later? 47 organic visitors. Total.

Meanwhile, a similar site I built on WordPress with the same content strategy? 3,200 visitors in the same period.

The problem isn't one thing—it's everything. Framer's sites load fast (which should help SEO), but their meta tag implementation is clumsy, schema markup is limited, and their URL structure is rigid. Most importantly, there's very little evidence of Framer sites ranking well in competitive searches.

If organic traffic is your goal, look elsewhere.

### 2. The CMS is Weak

Framer added a CMS. It's fine for simple stuff. A blog with 20 posts? Great. A portfolio with project categories? Works well.

But try building anything complex and you'll hit walls fast.

Site #6 was supposed to have:
- Products with multiple categories
- Related items based on tags
- User-submitted reviews
- Filtered search

I got two of those working. The other two required workarounds so ugly I'm embarrassed to admit them.

For simple content, Framer's CMS is acceptable. For anything ambitious, it's a straightjacket.

### 3. The Lock-In is Real

Framer doesn't export clean code. You can't download HTML/CSS and host elsewhere. You're married to their platform.

This bothered me less than I expected—until client #3 asked me to migrate their site to WordPress because their in-house team only knows WordPress.

38 hours of work later, I had rebuilt the site from scratch. There's no migration path. No export. Just start over.

If you build for clients, warn them about this upfront.

### 4. Scaling Gets Expensive Fast

The $10/month Basic plan looks reasonable. Here's what they don't tell you:

- Need more than 30 pages? Upgrade to Pro ($30/month)
- Want more than 1 CMS collection? Pro again
- Need staging environments? Pro required
- Adding team members? $20/month per person
- Client wants to edit content? That's another seat

By the time I had a typical client setup—staging, CMS, client editing access, a few dozen pages—I was at $70/month. Per site.

For one agency client with 3 Framer sites, we were paying more in Framer subscriptions than our entire Google Workspace bill.

### 5. E-commerce? Don't Bother

Framer has no native e-commerce. They'll tell you to integrate with Shopify or use an external checkout.

Translation: "Build your store somewhere else, then link to it."

If you're selling one digital product, this is fine. A full store? You're using the wrong tool.

## Who Should Use Framer

Use Framer if:

- **You're a designer who knows Figma.** The learning curve is nearly zero.
- **You need a portfolio or landing page fast.** 90 minutes from blank canvas to published.
- **Your clients want "premium" feel.** The animations genuinely impress.
- **You don't care about organic SEO.** Paid traffic, direct outreach, or existing audience.
- **Simple CMS needs only.** Blog, portfolio, maybe a small resource section.

## Who Should Avoid Framer

Skip Framer if:

- **SEO is your primary growth channel.** You will regret this choice.
- **You need complex data relationships.** The CMS can't handle it.
- **E-commerce is in your roadmap.** Build elsewhere from day one.
- **Your site will grow beyond 100 pages.** Scale plan gets pricey.
- **You might need to migrate later.** You're locked in for good.
- **You want to own your code.** You won't.

## How It Compares

I've tested 14 AI website builders. Here's where Framer lands:

| Builder | Best For | Price | My Rating |
|---------|----------|-------|-----------|
| Framer | Designers | $10-100/mo | 8/10 |
| **10Web** | WordPress users | $10-23/mo | 8.5/10 |
| Webflow | Power users | $14-39/mo | 8/10 |
| Wix AI | Beginners | $17-159/mo | 7/10 |
| Durable | Speed | $12-25/mo | 7.5/10 |

Framer wins on design experience. 10Web wins on WordPress flexibility. Webflow wins on raw power. Pick based on what matters most.

## Pricing Breakdown (Real Numbers)

| Plan | Monthly | Annual | What You Get |
|------|---------|--------|--------------|
| Free | $0 | $0 | 1 site, Framer branding, subdomain |
| Basic | $10 | $120/yr | Custom domain, 30 pages, 1 CMS collection |
| Pro | $30 | $300/yr | 150 pages, 10 CMS collections, staging |
| Scale | $100+ | $1,200+/yr | 300+ pages, 20+ CMS, enterprise CDN |

**Hidden costs to budget:**
- Domain: $10-15/year (free .com on annual plans)
- Extra editors: $20/month per person
- Translation: $20 per locale
- A/B testing: $50 per 500K events

**The free plan is genuinely usable** for testing. Build your whole site before paying. See if the workflow clicks.

## My Honest Recommendation

After 8 sites and 6 weeks, here's my take:

**Framer is the best website builder for designers who prioritize aesthetics over everything else.** No other tool lets you create something this polished this quickly. The animations are stunning. The interface is a joy. When a project is right for Framer, it's the best experience I've had building websites.

But that's a big "when."

If you need SEO, complex content, e-commerce, or future flexibility, Framer is the wrong choice. I learned this the hard way on sites #4 and #6.

The question isn't "is Framer good?" It absolutely is.

The question is: "is Framer good for MY specific needs?"

**For designer portfolios and simple landing pages:** Yes. 100%.

**For content sites and growing businesses:** No. Use 10Web or WordPress instead.

**For agencies serving design-focused clients:** Yes, with an asterisk. Warn clients about lock-in and SEO limitations upfront.

Try the free plan. Build something. You'll know within an hour if Framer's workflow matches your brain.
