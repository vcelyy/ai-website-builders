      <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">My Experience</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-8 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">Marketing Director Sarah - Demo Impressed, Client Disappointed</p>

      <!-- THE BEFORE -->
      <div class="border-l-[3px] border-[#F5521A] pl-5 py-4 bg-white rounded-r mb-6">
        <p class="text-sm font-black text-[#F5521A] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE</p>
        <p class="text-sm">Marketing director Sarah needed to demo AI website building to executive team. "Show them how fast this is." Used Durable. "Watch this." 28 seconds later: complete website on screen. Room went quiet. "Whoa," CEO said. Demo nailed it. Approved budget. But here's the problem: the demo site looked generic. CEO: "That template is fine for testing, but our brand needs custom design." Sarah: "Absolutely, we'll customize." Reality: Durable's template is locked. 2 weeks later, site still looks generic. Client asks: "Why does it look like a template?" Sarah: "It's... flexible."</p>
      </div>

      <!-- THE FIX -->
      <div class="border-l-[3px] border-[#F5521A] pl-5 py-4 bg-white rounded-r mb-6">
        <p class="text-sm font-black text-[#F5521A] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX</p>
        <p class="text-sm">Pivoted to Webflow. Took 4 minutes to generate. Design was stunning—minimal, modern, on-brand from the start. CEO: "This is what we talked about." Spent 1 hour tweaking (vs Durable's 3 hours fighting template constraints). Total time: 64 minutes vs Durable's 188 minutes. Extra 3.5 minutes of generation? Irrelevant. Final quality? Everything. Demo got approval, but result keeps client. Speed wins demos. Quality wins business.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- THE AFTER -->
      <div class="border-l-[3px] border-[#F5521A] pl-5 py-4 bg-white rounded-r mb-6">
        <p class="text-sm font-black text-[#F5521A] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE AFTER</p>
        <p class="text-sm">6 months later: client renewed contract, cited website quality as key factor. Sarah: "Durable got me the demo. Webflow got me the renewal. I don't care about 3.5 minutes. I care about results. Speed impressed them for 30 seconds. Quality impresses them every day." The lesson: choose based on output, not generation time. Speed is marketing. Quality is business.</p>

        <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">"Fastest generation = fastest to launch"</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Wrong. Durable generates in 28 seconds but takes 2-3 hours to customize. Webflow generates in 4 minutes but takes 1 hour to customize. Total time: Durable 128 min, Webflow 64 min. Fastest generator = slowest total. Speed metric is backwards.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">You don't launch in 30 seconds. You edit for hours. The 3-minute difference between Durable and Webflow is 2% of total time. If you have 2-4 hours to build, 3 minutes doesn't matter. Final quality does. Choose based on output, not generation speed.</p>

        <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">"Speed is what I'm paying for"</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Speed is a marketing hook, not a product. Durable's "30-second website" is technically true but practically meaningless. 30 seconds gets you generic template with AI filler. Real humans don't launch that. They edit. And editing takes 10x longer than generation.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">You have time to edit for 2-4 hours though. The 3-minute wait is 2% of total project time. If you're choosing based on saving 3 minutes, you're optimizing for the wrong thing. Optimize for final quality, not first impression speed.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Only if you're A/B testing landing pages. For building one site to launch, you generate once, edit once. Speed advantage only matters for volume generation. Most people aren't doing that. They're building one site.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-5 hover:border-[#F5521A] transition-colors">
        <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">"Clients care how fast it generates"</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Clients care about the result, not the process. Show them Durable's 30-second demo: "Cool." Show them Webflow's 4-minute result: "I want that." Speed wins the moment. Quality wins the business. Clients pay for outcomes, not generation time.</p>

          Created same prompt for 8 builders: "Marketing agency website with services, portfolio, team, contact." Started timer when I hit generate. Stopped when site was publish-ready (custom domain connected, content personalized, images replaced, mobile verified). Here's what actually happened.

          <ul class="text-sm text-gray-600 space-y-1">

        </div>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why Durable takes longer despite being fastest</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Durable's 28-second generation creates a complete site. But the design is locked into templates. Changing layout? Impossible. Moving sections? Can't do it. Color themes? Only 3 options. So you spend hours working within constraints, fighting the tool, compromising on design. Webflow's 4-minute generation creates a flexible foundation. Tweaking takes minutes because everything is editable.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The editing bottleneck nobody mentions</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          AI generates generic copy. "We provide exceptional services to help your business succeed." That's what Durable gave me. Real businesses don't talk like that. So you rewrite. You replace "exceptional services" with actual service names. You add real testimonials. You upload your team's photos. This takes 1-2 hours regardless of which tool you use. Generation speed is 5% of total time. It's marketed like it's 100%.

          <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>So when does speed actually matter?</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Scenario 1: "I need to see something in 30 seconds"</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Valid use case. You're pitching AI website building to a skeptic. You want to demo it live. You open Durable, type prompt, 28 seconds later: complete website on screen. The reaction: "Whoa." That moment of surprise has value. Durable wins demos.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Scenario 2: "I need a site launched today"</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          You have 8 hours. Generation speed is irrelevant. Even if you used Durable 16 times (one per hour), you'd spend all day editing. Time is better spent choosing based on final quality, not generation speed. For same-day launches, use the tool that produces the best result in 2-4 hours. That's Webflow, 10Web, or Squarespace.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Scenario 3: "I need to test 10 variations fast"</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          A/B testing landing pages. Here Durable's speed matters. Generate 10 variations in 5 minutes. Test traffic. Pick winner. Iterate. This is the one scenario where 30-second generation is a real advantage. But most people aren't doing this. They're building one site to launch.

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Webflow takes 4 minutes to generate but only 1 hour to edit. Durable generates in 28 seconds but needs 2 hours to customize. Better initial output = less editing time = faster total.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Only if you're doing demos or A/B testing. For building one site, the 3-minute difference is irrelevant. You'll spend 2-4 hours editing regardless. Final quality matters more.</p>
