Traditional options win on design quality, flexibility, and long-term cost. AI costs $15-30/month forever. Traditional costs $500-5000 upfront but $10/month ongoing. Choose AI for speed and simple projects. Choose traditional for control, customization, and long-term projects. The best choice depends on your specific situation, not which is 'better' overall."

          "text": "No. Testing shows AI-generated sites don't rank better than hand-built sites with the same content. Google cares about content quality, page speed, mobile optimization, and user experience—not how you built your site. A well-optimized AI site ranks the same as a well-optimized WordPress site. A poorly built AI site ranks worse than a well-built traditional site. Don't choose AI for SEO—focus on content quality and technical optimization regardless of platform."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "AI is cheaper upfront but more expensive over time. Over 3 years: Framer costs $540-900, Durable costs $432, WordPress with cheap hosting costs $108-360 total. A $2000 WordPress site plus $36/year hosting costs $2308 over 3 years—more expensive initially but cheaper long-term than most AI builders. The break-even point is typically 2-3 years. If you're building something long-term, traditional wins. For temporary sites or MVPs, AI wins."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Migration is painful and often requires rebuilding from scratch. Most AI builders (Framer, Durable, Mixo) don't export clean code or WordPress-compatible formats. Moving means: manually recreating content in WordPress, redesigning layouts from scratch, rebuilding features, fixing broken links and redirects. I've spent 40+ hours migrating sites that looked 'easy to build.' Some tools like 10Web and Webflow export better than others, but expect significant work if you switch. Choose wisely the first time—migration is expensive regardless of direction."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Developers fight AI builders because they expect control and want to tweak code. AI builders are designed for non-developers and limit code access. Experienced developers find AI builder constraints frustrating—can't modify HTML directly, limited CSS control, locked into platform-specific features, can't optimize performance, limited integration options. If you know how to code, you'll fight AI builder limitations more than using them. Developers prefer traditional options (WordPress, Webflow, custom code) where they have full control. The people who love AI builders are business owners who've never built a site before—they don't know what they're missing, and that's fine."

          "text": "Choose traditional development (WordPress, custom code, Webflow) when: building e-commerce with complex needs (custom checkout, inventory logic), need brand-focused unique design, require custom functionality AI builders can't handle, planning long-term investment and scaling, want to minimize ongoing costs, care about owning your code and data. Traditional options cost more upfront but offer complete control, better long-term economics, and no platform lock-in. If your project is complex or long-term, traditional wins despite higher initial cost."

								<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Are AI website builders better than traditional options?</h3>
								<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Neither is universally better. AI builders win on speed (30 seconds vs weeks) and simplicity (no coding required). Traditional options win on design quality, flexibility, and long-term cost. AI costs $15-30/month forever. Traditional costs $500-5000 upfront but $10/month ongoing. <strong class="text-orange-600">Choose AI for speed and simple projects. Choose traditional for control, customization, and long-term projects.</strong> The best choice depends on your specific situation, not which is "better" overall.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bg-white/60 backdrop-blur-sm border-2 border-orange-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
								<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Do AI website builders rank better on Google?</h3>
								<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">No. Testing shows AI-generated sites don't rank better than hand-built sites with the same content. Google cares about content quality, page speed, mobile optimization, and user experience—not how you built your site. <strong class="text-orange-600">A well-optimized AI site ranks the same as a well-optimized WordPress site.</strong> A poorly built AI site ranks worse than a well-built traditional site. Don't choose AI for SEO—focus on content quality and technical optimization regardless of platform.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bg-white/60 backdrop-blur-sm border-2 border-orange-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
								<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Is it cheaper to use AI builders or hire a developer?</h3>
								<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">AI is cheaper upfront but more expensive over time. Over 3 years: Framer costs $540-900, Durable costs $432, WordPress with cheap hosting costs $108-360 total. A $2000 WordPress site plus $36/year hosting costs $2308 over 3 years—more expensive initially but cheaper long-term than most AI builders. <strong class="text-orange-600">The break-even point is typically 2-3 years.</strong> If you're building something long-term, traditional wins. For temporary sites or MVPs, AI wins.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bg-white/60 backdrop-blur-sm border-2 border-orange-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
								<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I migrate from an AI builder to WordPress later?</h3>
								<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Migration is painful and often requires rebuilding from scratch. Most AI builders (Framer, Durable, Mixo) don't export clean code or WordPress-compatible formats. Moving means: manually recreating content in WordPress, redesigning layouts from scratch, rebuilding features, fixing broken links and redirects. <strong class="text-orange-600">I've spent 40+ hours migrating sites that looked "easy to build."</strong> Some tools like 10Web and Webflow export better than others, but expect significant work if you switch. Choose wisely the first time—migration is expensive regardless of direction.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bg-white/60 backdrop-blur-sm border-2 border-orange-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
								<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Why do developers hate AI website builders?</h3>
								<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Developers fight AI builders because they expect control and want to tweak code. AI builders are designed for non-developers and limit code access. Experienced developers find AI builder constraints frustrating—can't modify HTML directly, limited CSS control, locked into platform-specific features, can't optimize performance, limited integration options. <strong class="text-orange-600">If you know how to code, you'll fight AI builder limitations more than using them.</strong> Developers prefer traditional options (WordPress, Webflow, custom code) where they have full control. The people who love AI builders are business owners who've never built a site before—they don't know what they're missing, and that's fine.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bg-white/60 backdrop-blur-sm border-2 border-orange-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
								<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What's the hybrid approach for website building?</h3>
								<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The hybrid approach combines AI speed with traditional control: (1) Plan with AI tools like Relume to generate sitemap and wireframes in 20 minutes, (2) Review and iterate on structure with stakeholders, (3) Export wireframes from the AI tool, (4) Build the actual site in Framer, Webflow, React, or WordPress based on your needs, (5) Own everything with no platform lock-in. <strong class="text-orange-600">This workflow gives you AI planning speed without AI building limitations.</strong> Agencies and smart founders use this approach—AI handles boring planning work, humans handle actual building with full control.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="bg-white/60 backdrop-blur-sm border-2 border-orange-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
								<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">When should I choose traditional web development over AI?</h3>
								<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Choose traditional development (WordPress, custom code, Webflow) when: building e-commerce with complex needs (custom checkout, inventory logic), need brand-focused unique design, require custom functionality AI builders can't handle, planning long-term investment and scaling, want to minimize ongoing costs, care about owning your code and data. <strong class="text-orange-600">Traditional options cost more upfront but offer complete control, better long-term economics, and no platform lock-in.</strong> If your project is complex or long-term, traditional wins despite higher initial cost.</p>

Traditional builders (Wix, Squarespace, Webflow): Manual drag-and-drop editors, template libraries, feature marketplaces. Choose AI builders for: speed, validation, MVPs, non-designers.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">30 seconds to complete website</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">AI builders generate full websites in 30 seconds: Mixo, Durable, CodeDesign. Describe business, AI creates headline, sections, images, copy. Traditional builders: select template, customize each section manually (2-5 hours minimum). Speed advantage enables testing multiple concepts rapidly, launching MVPs same-day.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Startup tested 8 product concepts using Mixo AI. Each: 30 seconds generation + 15 minutes tweaks = 20 minutes per concept. Total: 2.7 hours validated all 8 ideas. Found winner: 47% higher conversion. Traditional builder would allow 1-2 concepts in same timeframe.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">AI builders write copy: headlines, descriptions, features, testimonials. Traditional builders: write all content manually or hire copywriter. For non-writers (developers, consultants, technical founders)—AI eliminates blank-page paralysis. Good copy published immediately beats perfect copy never finished.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Developer launching SaaS. Hated writing marketing copy. AI builder: generated all content in 30 seconds. Traditional builder: spent 12 hours writing, still unsatisfied. Launched AI-generated site, got first customer in 2 days. Perfectionism delayed revenue.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">AI builders generate mobile-optimized layouts automatically. Traditional builders: design desktop, manually adjust mobile (significant extra work). For prioritizing speed—avoiding mobile layout tweaks saves hours. Mobile traffic is 60%+—critical but time-consuming to optimize manually.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Event promoter needed site in 1 hour. AI builder: desktop + mobile perfect automatically.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">AI builders require minimal learning: describe what you need, AI builds it. Traditional builders: understanding drag-and-drop, styling, layouts—steeper curve. For non-designers, beginners, technical founders—AI builders eliminate learning time barrier. Start immediately, not after weeks of learning.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Non-technical founder compared AI vs traditional. AI builder: launched site in 1 hour first day. Traditional builder: spent 20 hours learning basics before site looked acceptable. AI learning curve: hours. Traditional: days to weeks.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
          <strong>AI builders (Mixo, Durable):</strong> 30-minute launch = 10-30x faster than Traditional. Consistent 7-8/10 quality = reliable baseline, no bad designs. $9-15/mo = lower entry cost. Limited customization = constrained to AI patterns (can't achieve 9/10 unique design). Recognition risk = AI-generated look identifiable. Best for: 90-day MVPs, idea validation, niche testing, temporary landing pages, non-designers who need site fast. Don't overinvest in unproven ideas. Launch on AI builder, test 60-90 days. If revenue validates, rebuild in Traditional for polish.<br/>
          <strong>Traditional builders (Wix, Squarespace, Webflow):</strong> 5-15 hour investment = template browsing + customization. Variable 5-9.5/10 quality = higher ceiling but lower floor (choose wrong template = stuck with 5/10). Full customization = unlimited design control (Webflow = pixel-perfect, code-level). Technical SEO 7.5-9/10 = schema, robots.txt control for competitive niches. $20-40/mo = higher cost but justified for revenue-generating sites. Best for: long-term businesses (2+ years), brand-focused sites (design = competitive advantage), SEO-critical niches (national keywords), e-commerce stores (need advanced features), design-heavy brands (unique aesthetics). Extra hours pay for themselves through: higher conversion (better UX design), better SEO rankings (technical control), brand differentiation (not AI template).<br/>
          <strong>Hybrid strategy (recommended):</strong> Use AI builders for discovery (find what works), Traditional for scale (polish winners). Phase 1: Launch 5-10 test sites on AI builder (30 min each = one weekend). Phase 2: Drive traffic, measure engagement 60-90 days. Phase 3: Identify winner(s) with traction. Phase 4: Rebuild winner(s) in Traditional builder (8-15 hours each). Total: 9.5-15.5 hours vs Traditional-only 25-75 hours for 5 sites. Saved 15-60 hours finding winners. Real example: Entrepreneur launched 10 niche sites on Mixo in weekend. 3 sites showed traction after 60 days. Rebuilt those 3 in Webflow. Result: 3 revenue-generating sites, 7 killed early, total time ~40 hours vs Traditional-only 100+ hours. Saved 60+ hours.<br/>
          <strong>Decision framework:</strong> Choose AI builder when: speed = first priority (need site NOW), testing phase (90-day MVP), limited budget ($9-15/mo vs $20-40/mo), non-designer (don't care about 9/10 perfection), temporary/campaign site (not long-term). Choose Traditional when: brand differentiation = competitive advantage, SEO critical (high competition niches), custom features needed (booking, e-commerce), long-term business (2+ years), design quality = revenue generator. Remember: AI builders = speed demons for testing. Traditional builders = business foundations for scaling. Start with AI to find winners, scale with Traditional to build champions.
