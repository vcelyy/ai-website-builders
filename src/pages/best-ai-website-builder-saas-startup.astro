Webflow (8.9/10) is best for complex SaaS with advanced interactive needs like custom calculators and multi-language support.

Most AI builders generate generic 'hero + 3 features + pricing + contact' layouts that look like every other SaaS template. Framer understands these needs natively with animations and interactivity built-in."

Squarespace at $23/month ($276/year) for quick validation. Custom development: $10,000-50,000+ upfront plus $2,000-5,000/year for maintenance. For seed-stage SaaS, AI builders save $9,700-49,700+ in year one. Post-Series A: justify custom development if you need unique functionality that platforms can't deliver. Most SaaS startups should use AI builders until $1M+ ARR."

Choose Webflow if: you need complex interactive elements (calculators, configurators), multi-language support is required, you have 3+ weeks to invest, you want export capability for self-hosting, and $23+/month budget is acceptable. For most SaaS startups: Framer for speed and aesthetics, Webflow for complex needs, Squarespace for pre-PMF validation."

Once you have 100-500 paying customers and product-market fit, rebuild with custom development or Webflow if needed. Migration path: export content from AI builder, work with developer to build custom site on React/Next.js, implement proper analytics/tracking, add advanced features (user dashboards, custom calculators), optimize for enterprise requirements (SSO, audit logs). Typical migration: $15,000-50,000 and 4-8 weeks. Time it right: migrate when you're scaling past $1M ARR, not before. Don't overbuild early."

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">SaaS used generic Wix template with "hero, 3 features, pricing" layout. Pitched 12 investors. 11 passed without second meeting. One investor: "Your site looks like every pitch deck I see this week. Do you have anything unique?" Rebuilt in Framer with custom interactive demo showing product working. Same investor: "This shows me what your product actually does. I can see you care about details." Closed $2.3M seed round. Generic templates signal "we're like everyone else."

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">B2B SaaS: pricing page defaulted to monthly. Annual pricing was on separate page. Only 12% chose annual. Added toggle on main pricing page: "Annual (save 20%)" with savings displayed prominently. Annual selection jumped to 59%. Why? Users didn't see annual option. When shown side-by-side with savings clear, they chose value. Don't make users calculate. Show savings upfront. Anchor monthly, discount annual.</p>

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">SaaS homepage: "Used by 10,000 businesses." Generic, unverifiable, noise. Changed to "Trusted by" with 6 recognizable company logos (customers). Trial signups: 3x increase. Why? Specific logos = credibility, social proof, "these companies trust them." Generic numbers = everyone claims 10,000, nobody verifies. Logos are visible proof. Even 6 recognizable logos beat "10,000 businesses." Name-drop carefully and strategically. Use your best customers.</p>

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">SaaS: static screenshots of product interface on homepage. Demo requests: 9/month. Added 30-second animated tour showing features in action—charts updating, data flowing, users engaging. Demo requests: 27/month. 300% increase. Why? Static screenshots = "I guess this works." Animated tour = "I see exactly how it works." Show product working, don't tell it works. Animation = understanding = leads. Complex products need demos, not screenshots.</p>

Changed to: "See who visited your site today. Understand their journey in real-time." Benefit-focused, specific, shows value. CTR increased 100%. Why? Users don't care what you ARE. They care what they GET. "Best platform" = noise. "See who visited" = value. Every word should answer "what's in it for me?"</p>

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">A/B tested identical SaaS sites with different loading speeds. Site A: 7 seconds load time. Site B: 1.8 seconds load time. Same content, same design, different hosting/optimization. Trial signups: Site A 3.2%, Site B 5.1%. Why? 53% abandon sites loading 3+ seconds. Faster site = more visitors see your content = more signups. Framer averages 95 PageSpeed. Wix averages 60. That's the difference between 3% and 5% conversion. On 10,000 visitors/month: 300 vs 500 trials. Speed isn't technical—it's revenue.</p>

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">Surveyed 23 seed-stage investors. Showed two SaaS sites: generic Wix template vs custom Framer design. 19/23 preferred custom design. Why? Generic templates signal "we're like everyone else, no technical capability, copy-paste startup." Custom design signals "we care about details, have technical ability, understand quality matters." Your website is your first product demo. Investors assume your code quality matches your site quality. Sloppy site = sloppy code assumption.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              2 weeks until first investor meetings. Needed professional site fast. Options: Hire developer ($15,000, 4 weeks), Use generic template (fast, looks like everyone else), Use Framer AI ($15/month, hours to build). Budget: $500. Time: urgent.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">THE FIX (Framer approach)</h3>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Used Framer AI to generate initial SaaS site. Customized with: Interactive product demo in hero (scroll to see analytics working), Animated metrics dashboard (numbers counting up), Annual/monthly pricing toggle with savings displayed, "Trusted by" section with beta customer logos, Integration grid showing all tools we connect to, Team section with founder photos. Build time: 6 hours. Cost: $15/month.

              Pitched 12 investors over 6 weeks. 11 second meetings. 3 term sheets. Closed $2.3M seed round at $18M cap. Investor feedback: "Your site made it clear you understood the problem," "The interactive demo showed me exactly what your product does," "This doesn't look like a template—you clearly care about details."
