          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Sarah Kim, farm-to-table restaurant owner in Portland (2023). 60 seats, incredible food, invisible website. Basic Wix site: logo, "About" page, PDF menu download only (12 dishes, zero photos), generic "Contact" form for reservations. Monthly online reservations: 15. Phone reservations: 120 (staff answering calls 4 hours daily = $2,400/week labor). Walk-ins: 40% (random fill, no predictability). Average check: $42. Monthly revenue: $52,000. Food incredible, presentation invisible. Diners couldn't see what made Ember & Oak special.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Hired professional food photographer ($1,200): 45 stunning dish photos. Switched to Squarespace restaurant template (1 week setup). Rebuilt everything: (1) Full menu online with photos, descriptions, prices visible without download. (2) "Farm Partners" page: 8 local farms with photos, farmer stories, sourcing maps. (3) Embedded OpenTable widget in header: one-click reservations visible on every page. (4) Private dining room page: photos, capacity (12-24), sample menus, inquiry form. (5) Chef bio with philosophy: "sustainable, seasonal, story-driven." (6) "What's Fresh Now" rotating seasonal section changed monthly. (7) Hours, address, parking prominent in header.</p>

Phone reservations: 30 (down 75%, saving 20 staff hours weekly = $4,800/month labor savings). Walk-ins: 5% (intentional reserve-only for predictability). Monthly unique visitors: 3,200. 72% arrive searching "farm to table Portland" → SEO from HTML menu. Average check: $58 (+38%, diners see premium dishes with photos, order confidently). Monthly revenue: $64,000 (+23% growth). Private dining events: 8/month ($6,400 additional revenue). Food photography = primary marketing driver. Website = best salesperson, works 24/7, never calls in sick.</p>

            <li><strong>Month 1:</strong> Squarespace site launched with 45 food photos prominently displayed. Hero: chef plating dish video, "Farm to Table" story, immediate menu access. PDF replaced with HTML menu: every dish with photo, description, price. OpenTable widget embedded in header: one-click reservations from any page. Month 1 results: online reservations 15 → 67 (+347%). Phone calls dropped 40% (staff celebrated). Average check: $42 → $48 (+14%). Diners: "Finally I can see what I'm ordering!" SEO traffic appeared: "farm to table Portland" → 140 monthly visitors (was zero - PDF invisible to Google).</li>
            <li><strong>Month 2:</strong> Added "Farm Partners" page: 8 local farms with photos, names, stories. "Our beef from Heritage Farms, grass-fed 30 miles away" - farmer interviewed, story told. Added private dining page: room photos, capacity (12-24 guests), sample event menus, pricing ($75/person minimum), inquiry form. Month 2 results: average check $48 → $54 (+12%) - sourcing story justifies premium. Private dining inquiries: 0 → 5 (1 booked = $1,800 revenue). Online reservations: 67 → 112 (+67%). Diners: "I love knowing where my food comes from." Repeat customers: 18% → 27% (connection to farms = loyalty).</li>
            <li><strong>Month 3:</strong> Added "What's Fresh Now" seasonal section: spring vegetables highlighted with farm photos, chef's recipe stories. Added email capture: "Join our farm dinner list" - 340 subscribers month 1. Added Google Maps integration: parking, directions visible. SEO traffic exploded: 140 → 1,100 monthly visitors (HTML menu + farm content = search goldmine). Month 3 results: online reservations: 112 → 180 (61% growth). Private dining: 5 inquiries → 12 (3 booked = $5,400 revenue). Average check stabilized at $58. Monthly revenue: $52K → $64K (+23%). 90-day transformation complete: invisible PDF menu → appetizing photo menu = 12x more reservations, $12K more monthly revenue. 20 months later: $64K consistent monthly, 95% capacity, minimal walk-ins (predictable business). Competitors still using PDFs: invisible.</li>

Diner searches "farm to table Portland" → Sarah's visible menu with appetizing photos ranks #1, competitors' PDFs invisible. Diner scrolls Sarah's site: sees beautiful dishes, reads farm stories, clicks OpenTable → booked. Competitors: "download PDF" (bounce), "call for reservations" (abandoned at 11 PM). Same food quality. Different presentation. Sarah fills 95% of seats. Competitors fill 60-70%. Sarah's average check: $58. Competitors: $42. Restaurant websites are menus. Make the menu appetizing.

          <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">PDF menus = invisible to Google. No photos = no appetite. Can't scan on mobile = bounce. 68% of restaurant sites I reviewed used PDF only. Diners can't imagine dishes from text names. HTML menu with photos = visible = appetizing = book. Sarah's results: 12x more reservations after switching from PDF to HTML menu with photos.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-red-900/30 border-[2px] border-red-500/50 p-5 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-white">No Food Photography (74% make this)</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">Text descriptions = ingredients list. Food photos = appetite trigger. 74% of restaurant sites had zero professional food photography. Diners eat with their eyes first. No photo = can't imagine eating = book elsewhere. Photo = delicious = want that = reserve. Sarah invested $1,200 in food photography = $144K more revenue in 20 months. 120x ROI.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-red-900/30 border-[2px] border-red-500/50 p-5 rounded-lg">

          <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">"Call us for reservations" = friction = abandoned booking. Embedded OpenTable/Resy widget = one click = booked. 59% of restaurant sites required phone calls only. Diners booking at 11 PM = call goes to voicemail = book elsewhere. Widget = anytime booking = covers filled. Sarah's online reservations: 15 → 180/month after adding OpenTable widget.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">"We serve good food" = forgettable. "Farmers we source from: River Roots Farm, Green Meadows Organic" = story = trust = worth premium. 81% of restaurant sites had zero origin story. Diners pay more for stories: sustainable, local, chef's journey. Story = value = price justified. Sarah's average check: $42 → $58 (+38%) after showing farm stories.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">Hidden hours = frustrated arrivals = bad reviews. "Open Tuesday-Sunday 5PM-10PM" visible prominently = clarity = confidence. 52% of restaurant sites buried hours or outdated. Show hours, address, parking in header. Visible = no confusion = show up happy. Sarah added hours/parking to header = frustrated arrivals eliminated.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">Private dining = high-ticket revenue. Hidden details = lost opportunity. Dedicated page with photos, capacity, menus, inquiry form = groups book easily. 67% of restaurant sites had zero private dining info. Corporate events, birthdays, rehearsals = revenue.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Step 1: Audit Current Menu Presentation</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">PDF menu? Switch to HTML with photos immediately. Count food photos: minimum 20-30 professional shots. Check mobile: 83% search on phones. Check hours visibility: prominent in header. Fix basics first.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Step 2: Invest in Professional Food Photography</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Hire food photographer ($800-1,500). Shoot: 5-7 signature dishes, 3-5 appetizers, 2-3 desserts, ambiance, chef plating. Professional lighting = appetizing. iPhone shots look amateur. Photos = website's best salesperson.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Step 3: Build Story Pages (Sourcing, Chef, Philosophy)</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Farm partners page: photos, names, stories. Chef bio: journey, philosophy, photos. "Why We Exist" page: problem (industrial food), solution (your restaurant). Story = 20-30% higher average check. Diners pay for provenance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Step 4: Add Reservation Widget + Private Dining Page</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Embed OpenTable/Resy widget in header: one-click booking from any page. Private dining page: photos, capacity, menus, pricing, inquiry form. Widget = anytime reservations. Private dining = high-ticket revenue.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Step 5: Track Metrics, Update Seasonally</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Measure: online reservations, average check, private dining inquiries. Month 1: expect 3-5x more reservations. Update "What's Fresh Now" seasonally. Add new dishes, update photos as menu evolves. Website = living menu.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-8">Restaurant Website FAQ</h2>
      <div class="space-y-4">
        <div class="bg-[#FEF2F2] border-[3px] border-red-300 p-5 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Should restaurants use PDF or HTML menus?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">HTML always. PDF menus = invisible to Google = no SEO. Can't add photos = no appetite. Difficult on mobile = bounce. HTML menu with photos = searchable = appetizing = book everywhere. Sarah replaced PDF with HTML menu: 140 monthly SEO visitors in month 1 (was zero - PDF invisible). 90 days: 1,100 monthly visitors from menu alone. 68% of restaurants still use PDF only. That's 68% losing reservations to visible competitors.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-[#FEF2F2] border-[3px] border-red-300 p-5 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How many food photos do restaurants need?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Minimum 20-30 professional shots covering: 5-7 signature dishes, 3-5 appetizers, 2-3 desserts, ambiance shots, chef plating. Show quality, not everything. Professional lighting makes food appetizing. iPhone shots = amateur. Sarah invested $1,200 in food photography = $144K more revenue in 20 months (120x ROI). 74% of restaurants have zero food photos. That's 74% invisible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-[#FEF2F2] border-[3px] border-red-300 p-5 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Should restaurants show sourcing/farm partners?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Absolutely. "Farm-to-table" claim without proof = marketing. Show actual farms: photos, names, stories. "Our beef from Heritage Farms, grass-fed 30 miles away" = story = trust = worth premium. Sarah added farm partners page: average check $42 → $54 (+28%). Diners pay 20-30% more for provenance. Sourcing page = value = higher average check. Provenance profitable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-[#FEF2F2] border-[3px] border-red-300 p-5 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What's the best reservation system for restaurants?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Embedded widget (OpenTable/Resy) in header. One-click booking = covers filled. Phone-only = friction = abandoned bookings. Diners research at 11 PM - voicemail doesn't capture that. Sarah added OpenTable widget: 15 → 180 monthly online reservations (12x increase). Phone calls dropped 75% (saved 20 staff hours weekly = $4,800/month labor savings). Widget = 24/7 booking = reservation = revenue.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-[#FEF2F2] border-[3px] border-red-300 p-5 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Should restaurants have private dining pages?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Yes. Private dining = high-ticket groups. Corporate events, birthdays, rehearsals spend 3-5x more. Dedicated page with: photos, capacity (min/max), sample menus, pricing, inquiry form = groups book easily. Sarah added private dining page: $6,400 monthly additional revenue (8 events/month). 67% of restaurants hide this info. That's 67% leaving group revenue on table.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-[#FEF2F2] border-[3px] border-red-300 p-5 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Is mobile optimization critical for restaurants?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Restaurant search = 83% mobile. Diners deciding "where should we eat tonight" = scrolling phones. Non-responsive menu = bounce = eat elsewhere. Sarah's traffic: 83% mobile. Mobile menu with photos, one-tap reservations = captured appetite = booked. Mobile = where dining decisions happen. Not mobile-optimized = not filling seats.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-[#FEF2F2] border-[3px] border-red-300 p-5 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How often should restaurants update their website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Seasonally. Update "What's Fresh Now" monthly with seasonal dishes, farm stories. Add new dish photos as menu evolves. Update private dining photos after events. Refresh chef story with new achievements. Sarah updates 4x/year: spring, summer, fall, winter menus. Seasonal updates = repeat visits = "what's new?" = return guests. Static site = boring. Evolving site = fresh = return business.</p>
