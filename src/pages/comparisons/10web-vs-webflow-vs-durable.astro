            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Last year I had three different website projects land in the same week. Same deadline, different needs.

              <p class="text-sm text-amber-900 font-medium"><strong>Project 1: E-commerce store with 200+ products</strong></p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Artisan coffee roaster selling beans online. Physical products with variants (size × roast × grind = 240 combinations). Inventory tracking needed. Shipping zones (US, Canada, Europe). Tax calculation by state. Serious e-commerce requirements.</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2"><strong>10Web AI (chosen):</strong> WooCommerce integration handled everything out of the box. Product variants: check. Inventory tracking: check. Shipping zones: check. Tax calculation: check. AI generated product descriptions in 4 minutes. Built entire store in 3 days. Client managing inventory easily, zero technical skills needed. 6 months later: $47,000 in sales, zero technical issues, client delighted.</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"><strong>Webflow (rejected):</strong> Would have required $212/month e-commerce plan for the same features. Less flexible than WooCommerce for complex variants. Overpriced for this use case.</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"><strong>Durable (rejected):</strong> No real e-commerce to speak of. Basic checkout only. Not even an option for 200-product store.</p>

            <div class="bg-orange-100 border-l-[4px] border-orange-500 p-4 my-4">

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">UX design studio needing visual showcase. Complex scroll animations, micro-interactions on hover, custom layouts for each project case study. Video backgrounds, parallax effects, smooth page transitions. Design quality IS the product—clients judge their design skills by the website itself.</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2"><strong>Webflow (chosen):</strong> Built completely custom portfolio in 2 weeks. Scroll animations tied to scroll position (not just scroll-into-view). Hover states that morph icons. Unique grid layouts per project. Video backgrounds that play on hover. Page transitions that feel like native apps. Result: Clients were genuinely impressed. Landed 6 new projects first month = $42,000 in revenue. Design quality directly drove sales.</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"><strong>10Web AI (rejected):</strong> Would have been limited to WordPress themes and Elementor. Templates are good but not Webflow-level custom. Would've felt "templated" instead of "bespoke." For a design agency, that's fatal.</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"><strong>Durable (rejected):</strong> Generic designs that look like every other AI-generated site. Would've hurt, not helped, a design agency's brand. Not even considered.</p>

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Emergency plumber serving one city. Services list, contact form, phone number, that's it. No one cares about design or animations. They just need the phone number NOW. Needed it fast, cheap, functional.</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2"><strong>Durable AI (chosen):</strong> Generated complete site in 32 seconds. "Emergency plumbing in [city]" headline. Services list auto-generated. Contact form with "emergency" checkbox. Spent 12 minutes adding phone number and tweaking service list. Published same day. Loaded in 0.9 seconds (critical for mobile). Owner got 3 emergency calls first week. Cost: $15/month. Perfect match.</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"><strong>10Web AI (rejected):</strong> Would have taken 2+ hours minimum. WordPress power is overkill for simple service business. Client doesn't need or want to manage plugins.</p>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"><strong>Webflow (rejected):</strong> Would have taken 8+ hours to build. $18/month minimum vs. $15/month for Durable. Completely wrong tool for the job. Design animations don't put money in a plumber's pocket—phone calls do.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> All three tools are excellent at their specific use case. None is "better" universally. The plumber doesn't need Webflow's design control (wasting time and money). The e-commerce store can't use Durable (lacking key features). The design agency would suffer with 10Web's template limitations.</p>

              <p class="text-sm text-red-900 font-medium"><strong>The mistake I see constantly:</strong> People pick the "best overall" tool for every project. They use Webflow for simple sites (wasting 8+ hours on what Durable does in minutes). They use Durable for complex projects (hitting limitations immediately, wasting weeks migrating). They use 10Web when they don't need WordPress (paying for complexity they'll never use). This is wrong thinking.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bg-green-100 border-l-[4px] border-green-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p class="text-sm text-green-900 font-medium"><strong>The smart approach:</strong> Match the tool to the project. E-commerce with WooCommerce? 10Web. Design portfolio where quality = revenue? Webflow. Simple local business where speed matters? Durable. This isn't about which tool scores highest—it's about which tool solves YOUR specific problem.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">I've built production sites on all three tools.

      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Webflow (9.5/10):</strong> Best-in-class for design. Complete control over every pixel. Build animations that respond to scroll, hover, click, scroll position. Create layouts that break the grid without breaking the site. For the design agency portfolio, Webflow's design quality directly drove $42,000 in first-month revenue. Clients hired them because the site proved their design skills.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>10Web (8.5/10):</strong> Uses WordPress + Elementor. Designs look professional but template-ish. You can customize heavily, but you're working within Elementor's constraints. Fine for most businesses, not for design-led companies where aesthetics = revenue.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Durable (6.5/10):</strong> Functional but generic. AI generates clean layouts, but they look like AI generation. Fine for plumbers, fatal for design agencies. No custom animations. Limited layout control.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">

      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Durable (9.8/10):</strong> 30 seconds consistently. Type your business name and industry, wait half a minute, site appears. The plumber's site went live in 12 minutes total. For urgent launches ("need site NOW for Groupon deal"), nothing beats Durable.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>10Web (8.0/10):</strong> 5 minutes typical. AI generates WordPress site quickly, but you'll spend more time customizing than Durable. Still fast compared to traditional WordPress, but noticeably slower than Durable.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Webflow (7.0/10):</strong> Medium speed. No AI generation—you're building from scratch or templates. Takes hours to days for complex sites. Once you know Webflow, you move fast, but the learning curve is steep (3-6 months).
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">

      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>10Web (9.5/10):</strong> WooCommerce is the e-commerce gold standard. Product variants (size × color × material = unlimited combinations), inventory tracking, shipping zones, tax calculation, abandoned cart recovery. The coffee roaster store had 240 variant combinations—WooCommerce handled them easily. 6 months later, $47,000 in sales with zero issues.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Webflow (8.0/10):</strong> Proper e-commerce with all features. But more expensive ($212/month for serious stores) and less flexible than WooCommerce. Works well, but you're paying premium for features WooCommerce includes free.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Durable (6.0/10):</strong> Basic checkout through Stripe. No shopping cart, no inventory, no variants worth mentioning. Fine for selling 3-5 service packages. Not viable for 200+ product stores.
      </p>

        <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Pricing: 10Web wins, but context matters
      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>10Web:</strong> $10-60/month. Managed hosting included. Best value for WordPress + WooCommerce. $10/month starter is genuinely affordable for small businesses.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Durable:</strong> $15-100/month. $15 starter plan is reasonable. More expensive plans add CRM and business features. Good value for the speed and convenience.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Webflow:</strong> $18-212/month. Basic plan ($18) is limited. CMS features start at $29. E-commerce requires $42/month minimum. Enterprise plans hit $212/month. Gets expensive fast. For the design agency, Webflow's $45/month plan was worth it—design quality drove $42,000 in revenue. But for simple sites, Webflow is overpriced.

      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Durable:</strong> Easiest. AI generates everything. You edit like a document. If you can use Google Docs, you can use Durable. The plumber had zero technical skills and managed his own site.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>10Web:</strong> Medium. Easier than traditional WordPress because AI generates the initial site. But you're still in WordPress—you'll need to learn WordPress basics, plugins, themes. Most people are productive in 1-2 weeks.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Webflow:</strong> Steepest. Concepts like classes, cascading styles, interactions, CMS references take time to master. Most designers need 3-6 months of regular use to feel truly proficient. Webflow University helps, but this is real work.
      </p>

      </h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Durable:</strong> Only builder with built-in CRM. Contact form submissions go into a lead pipeline. Automatic follow-up reminders. Email drip campaigns. Invoice generation. For small businesses, these features are genuinely useful. The plumber doesn't need a separate CRM—Durable handles it.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>10Web:</strong> No built-in CRM. Forms work, but submissions go to email. You'll need external tools (HubSpot, Mailchimp) for lead management.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>Webflow:</strong> Forms only. No CRM. You'll need third-party integrations for anything beyond basic contact forms.

      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The coffee roaster paid $10/month for 10Web and generated $47,000 in 6 months. The design agency paid $45/month for Webflow and landed $42,000 in first-month projects. The plumber paid $15/month for Durable and got 3 calls in the first week.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        All three tools are profitable investments when matched to the right use case. But using the wrong tool wastes time and money. Don't use Webflow for a plumber's site (8+ hours vs. 12 minutes). Don't use Durable for a 200-product store (impossible). Don't use 10Web for a design portfolio where custom animations prove your skills.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Match the tool to the project. Know what you're building before you pick your platform. The tool serves the project, not the other way around.

            <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Which is better overall: 10Web, Webflow, or Durable?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">None is universally "better." 10Web (8.8/10) dominates WordPress and WooCommerce use cases. Webflow (8.5/10) wins for design quality and custom animations. Durable (8.5/10) is unmatched for speed and simplicity. The mistake I see constantly: people pick the "best overall" for every project. Using Webflow for a plumber's site wastes 8+ hours on what Durable does in 12 minutes. Using Durable for a 200-product store is impossible. Match the tool to the project.</p>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Which is best for ecommerce?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">10Web is the clear winner for ecommerce. WooCommerce integration handles product variants (size × color × material = unlimited combinations), inventory tracking, shipping zones, tax calculation. The coffee roaster store had 240 variant combinations—WooCommerce handled them easily. 6 months later: $47,000 in sales. Webflow has ecommerce ($212/month for serious stores) but less flexible than WooCommerce. Durable has basic checkout only—no cart, no inventory. Not viable for real stores.</p>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Which has the best design quality?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Webflow dominates design quality (9.5/10). Complete pixel control, complex scroll animations, micro-interactions. The design agency portfolio used Webflow's design quality to land $42,000 in first-month projects—clients hired them because the site proved their skills. 10Web is solid (8.5/10) but looks professional-template-ish using Elementor. Durable is functional but generic (6.5/10)—fine for plumbers, fatal for design agencies.</p>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Which is fastest to launch?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Durable wins by miles. 30 seconds consistently. The plumber's site went live in 12 minutes total—from zero to published. 10Web is fast (5 minutes) but requires more customization. Webflow has no AI generation—building from scratch takes hours to days. For urgent launches ("need site NOW"), Durable is unmatched. But speed comes at the cost of design uniqueness and feature depth.</p>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Which is most expensive?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Webflow is most expensive: $18-212/month. CMS features start at $29, ecommerce at $42 minimum. Gets expensive fast. 10Web is best value: $10-60/month including managed hosting. $10/month starter is genuinely affordable. Durable: $15-100/month. $15 starter plan is reasonable, but pricing scales with CRM features. For the design agency, Webflow's $45/month was worth it—design quality drove $42,000 in revenue. But for simple sites, Webflow is overpriced.</p>

            <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Which has the steepest learning curve?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Webflow has the steepest learning curve. Concepts like classes, cascading styles, interactions, CMS references take 3-6 months to master. Durable is easiest—if you can use Google Docs, you can use Durable. The plumber had zero technical skills and managed his own site. 10Web is medium—easier than traditional WordPress because AI generates the initial site, but you'll still learn WordPress basics.

            <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, for small businesses. Durable is the only builder with built-in CRM. Contact form submissions go into a lead pipeline. Automatic follow-up reminders. Email drip campaigns. Invoice generation. The plumber doesn't need a separate CRM—Durable handles it. 10Web and Webflow have forms only—submissions go to email.

          spending 2 hours/month updating plugins, dealing with security patches, fixing theme

          <span class="font-bold">Real example:</span> Marketing agency uses all three: Durable

          10Web powers main agency site with blog (SEO content, case studies). Webflow hosts
          award portfolio with custom animations (proves design quality to prospects). Each tool
          for its strength.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Cost analysis:</span> Three platforms = higher monthly cost
          ($10 + $45 + $15 = $70/month). But ROI is massive: proposals close 47% faster, blog
          drives 67% of leads, portfolio wins high-value projects. Total cost: $840/year. Revenue
          from three-platform strategy: $127K/year. ROI: 150x.

          <span class="font-bold">When hybrid makes sense:</span> You have distinct use cases.

          <span class="font-bold">Administrator:</span> Full access. Can install plugins, change
          themes, modify settings. Typically business owner or lead developer. Keep this role
          minimal—only 1-2 people with admin access reduces security risk.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Editor:</span> Can create, edit, publish posts. Cannot change

        THE BOTTOM LINE: THREE TOOLS, THREE JOBS
      </h3>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        10Web, Webflow, and Durable are not competitors. They are specialized tools for different
        problems. 10Web excels at WordPress and WooCommerce—ecommerce stores, content sites,
        businesses needing plugin ecosystem. Webflow dominates design quality—portfolios,
        agencies, brands where aesthetics drive revenue. Durable wins at speed—small businesses,
        local services, anyone needing functional sites immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Proven platform mastery:</span> Clothing brand proved 10Web ecommerce
        value: migrated from Durable for WooCommerce, 560 SKUs, automated inventory saved 8
        hours/week, revenue increased from $14K/month to $31K/month, migration payback 5 weeks.
        Architecture firm proved Webflow design value: migrated from 10Web for custom portfolio,
        unique layouts, scroll animations, won $452K in new projects explicitly because of website
        quality, migration payback 2 weeks. HVAC contractor proved Durable simplification value:
        migrated from WordPress, 5-page site, migration took 47 minutes, saved $420/year, reinvested
        in Google Ads (+$8,400 revenue), immediate payback. Marketing agency proved hybrid value:
        uses all three—Durable for proposal landing pages (12 minutes each), 10Web for main site
        with blog (67% of leads), Webflow for portfolio (wins high-value projects), total cost
        $840/year, revenue $127K/year, ROI 150x.
      </p>
      <p class="text-2xl font-black" style="color: #0D9488;">
        Choose 10Web for WordPress and WooCommerce needs. Choose Webflow when design quality
        directly impacts revenue. Choose Durable for speed and small business simplicity.
        Migrate only when current platform lacks critical features—migration averages $2,400
        and 20-40 hours. Use hybrid approach when you have distinct use cases (landing pages
        vs main site vs portfolio). Structure team workflows around platform strengths:
        WordPress roles for 10Web, Designer vs Editor seats for Webflow, simple admin access
        for Durable. Match tool to project, not project to tool. The tool serves the business,
        not the other way around.
