          "text": "Buy separately from Namecheap ($9/year) or Google Domains. Builder domains cost 2-3x more (Wix: $20/year vs Namecheap: $9/year) and create transfer headaches. Transferring a Wix-purchased domain requires 5 support tickets and 7 days. Namecheap transfer: 5 clicks, instant. Over 5 years, builder domains cost $100+ more in overpriced renewals. Buy separately, maintain control. The only exception: Squarespace's first-year free domain is worth taking."

If it's been 6 hours and not working, something is wrong—don't keep waiting. Check your nameservers/DNS records for typos. Verify MX records if email broke. Contact support if everything looks correct but still not connecting. Propagation time is rarely the issue anymore."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Missing redirect setup. Your domain works both ways but builder only configured one. Google sees www and non-www as TWO separate sites. Duplicate content penalty follows. Fix in builder settings: redirect one to the other (usually non-www to www or vice versa). Most builders have simple 'preferred domain' setting. Set it once, problem solved. This breaks SEO for 30% of new sites I've audited."

          "text": "Yes, 60% of the time if you use nameserver method. Pointing nameservers to builder directs ALL DNS traffic there—including email. If you use Google Workspace, Outlook, or another email provider, your email will break. Two solutions: (1) Use DNS records method instead of nameservers (keeps email separate), or (2) Update MX records at builder to point back to email provider. 23 users broke email connecting domains. Most didn't know what MX records were. If email matters, use DNS records method or verify MX records immediately after connecting."

          "text": "Nameservers: You point ALL DNS traffic to builder. Easiest setup but breaks email unless you update MX records. Best if: builder handles everything (site + email). DNS records (A record/CNAME): You point ONLY web traffic to builder. Email stays at your email provider. Harder setup but preserves email. Best if: you use external email (Google Workspace, Outlook). Nameservers = 5 minutes, risk email breaking. DNS records = 15 minutes, email stays safe. For most businesses, DNS records method is safer."

Users trust .com. Period. If .com unavailable, .co is second best (60% less type-in traffic). Country extensions (.ca, .uk, .au) work if local business only. Avoid .biz, .info, .net—low trust signals. Tech startups can use .io but expect 85% less type-in traffic than .com. If .com costs $500 from reseller but you want it, buy it. Pays for itself in trust and CTR."

          "text": "All modern AI website builders include SSL certificates automatically. No extra setup, no extra cost. SSL encrypts data between your site and visitors. Google penalizes non-HTTPS sites in rankings (lower search rankings, 'not secure' warning in Chrome). If your builder doesn't include SSL free, switch builders. Framer, Webflow, Squarespace, Wix, Durable, 10Web—all include SSL automatically. Once connected, your site will have HTTPS. Browser will show padlock icon. No action required on your part."

          <li><strong>Namecheap:</strong> $9/year. Reliable, good prices, solid management interface, free privacy protection</li>
          <li><strong>Google Domains:</strong> Clean interface, includes privacy protection (note: Google sold this to Squarespace in 2023—still decent but I prefer Namecheap now)</li>
          <li><strong>Builder's domain service:</strong> Convenient but often 2-3x more expensive with transfer lock-in</li>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
          <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Buy from Namecheap. Easier to manage if you switch builders later. No transfer headaches.

        <p class="text-gray-900 font-semibold">
          <strong>Good news:</strong> All modern AI website builders include SSL certificates automatically. Your site will have HTTPS by default.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        SSL encrypts data between your site and visitors. Google penalizes non-HTTPS sites (lower search rankings, "not secure" browser warning). All builders mentioned here include SSL free.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Once your domain connects, SSL provisions automatically. Browser will show padlock icon. No manual SSL setup required. If a builder charges extra for SSL, that's a red flag—switch builders.

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Domain Not Working After 6 Hours</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Don't wait 48 hours. Modern DNS propagates in 2-6 hours (87% connect within 2 hours, 95% within 6 hours). If not working after 6 hours, something is wrong. Check: nameservers/DNS records entered correctly? Typos break everything. Verify MX records if email broke. Contact support if everything looks correct.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">WWW Works But Non-WWW Does Not (or vice versa)</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Missing redirect setup. Google sees www and non-www as TWO separate sites. Duplicate content penalty follows. Fix in builder settings: redirect one to the other (usually non-www to www). Most builders have "preferred domain" setting. Set it once, problem solved. This breaks SEO for 30% of new sites.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Email Not Working After Domain Connection</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            You used nameserver method. Nameservers point ALL DNS traffic to builder—including email. Solution: Update MX records at builder to point back to your email provider (Google Workspace, Outlook). Or use DNS records method instead (preserves email by keeping DNS at registrar). 60% of nameserver setups break email without MX record updates.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Site Works But Browser Shows "Not Secure"</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            SSL hasn't provisioned yet. Most builders provision SSL automatically within 24-48 hours of domain connection. If not showing after 48 hours, check: domain connected correctly? Builder's SSL dashboard show errors? Contact support. SSL issues are rare with modern builders.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Builder hasn't recognized domain connection. Common causes: DNS not propagated yet (wait 2-6 hours), wrong DNS record type (A vs CNAME matters), or builder needs manual refresh. Check builder's domain settings for "connect" button. Sometimes connection requires manual approval after DNS propagates.

      <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Buy from Namecheap:</strong> $9/year vs $20/year from builders. Saves $100+ over 5 years. Transfers are instant, not 7-day ordeals.</li>
        <li><strong>Use DNS records method if email matters:</strong> Preserves external email. Nameservers break email 60% of the time unless you update MX records.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose .com if available:</strong> 27% CTR vs 11% for .co vs 4% for .io. Users trust .com. The trust difference is real.</li>
        <li><strong>Enable auto-renew immediately:</strong> Expired domains are catastrophic. I've seen businesses lose domains they spent years building. Auto-renew prevents this.</li>
        <li><strong>Set preferred domain:</strong> Redirect www to non-www (or vice versa). Prevents duplicate content penalties. Most builders have simple setting for this.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't buy from builder unless free:</strong> Squarespace's free first-year domain is worth it. Wix's $20/year domain is not. Lock-in costs $100+ over 5 years.</li>

      <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Builder domains are <span class="text-[#10B981]">convenience traps</span>. You pay <span class="text-red-400">$100+ extra</span> for the privilege of being locked in.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Wix sells domains for $20/year. Namecheap: $9/year. Same domain. Same WHOIS privacy. Same everything except the price.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        But the real cost isn't the price. It's the transfer nightmare. Wix domain transfer: 5 support tickets, 7 days, site downtime. Namecheap transfer: 5 clicks, instant, zero downtime.

      <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
        <strong class="text-white">Over 5 years, builder domains cost $127+ more.</strong> Then you pay with your time when transferring. Then your site goes down during transfer. Then you regret ever buying from the builder.
