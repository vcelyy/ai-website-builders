        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-8 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">February 2025 | Austin, Texas | Real agency growth project</p>

        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">

            <p class="text-sm font-black text-rose-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-2">THE BEFORE</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Sarah ran a boutique content marketing agency in Austin with a 12-person team. Great work—conservative B2B clients, steady $35K/month retainers. But she was stuck. Same client tier for 3 years. Wanted to break into enterprise but couldn't get in the door. Her website: generic "full-service marketing agency" homepage. Vague capabilities list ("SEO, PPC, Social"). Portfolio thumbnails with project names only—no results, no methodology, no outcomes. Team photos with names and generic titles. Contact form buried in footer. RFP inquiries: 4/month. Average project size: $8K. Revenue flatlined at $420K/year.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-pink-50 border-l-[3px] border-pink-600 pl-6 py-4 mb-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="text-sm font-black text-pink-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-2">THE FIX</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Rebuilt her Webflow portfolio in 4 days. Added "B2B SaaS Marketing Specialization" prominently (clear positioning). Created 6 detailed case studies with specific results: "312% organic traffic growth, 8 months • $1.2M pipeline generated, Q3 2024 • 67% lead form conversion increase, 3 months." Added team bios with previous enterprise experience: "Sarah: Former Content Lead at HubSpot • Mike: Ex-Growth Marketing at Salesforce • Jenna: Previously SEO Manager at Shopify." Made process methodology visible ("Research → Strategy → Create → Distribute → Measure"). Added clear project inquiry form with qualifying questions (budget, timeline, project type, goals).</p>

          <div class="bg-fuchsia-50 border-l-[3px] border-fuchsia-600 pl-6 py-4 mb-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="text-sm font-black text-fuchsia-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-2">THE AFTER</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700">Month 1: 22 RFP inquiries (up from 4/month = 450% increase). Specialization filtered out wrong fits—90% were qualified B2B SaaS vs. 20% before. Sarah filled her capacity with higher-value projects. Landed $48K/year contract with Fortune 500 tech company (largest single client ever). 8 Fortune 1000 companies reached out (vs. 0 before). Month 1 revenue: $96K new bookings (up from $32K average = 200% increase). Average project size: $24K (up 200% from $8K).</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Days 1-7 (Launch):</strong> Webflow site rebuild (16 hours total), "B2B SaaS Marketing Specialists" positioning added prominently above hero section, 6 detailed case studies created with specific results (SaaS Lead Generation: 312% organic traffic growth in 8 months, $1.2M pipeline generated Q3 2024, 67% lead form conversion increase in 3 months; Enterprise SEO: $2.1M revenue attributed to organic traffic in 12 months; Content Strategy: 447% more blog leads, 18-month campaign; Demand Generation: 89% sales acceptance increase, 6-month program; Account-Based Marketing: 23 Fortune 500 target accounts engaged, $4.2M pipeline; Product Launch: 8,200 trial signups in 6 weeks, $1.8M pipeline), team bios rewritten with previous enterprise experience (Sarah: Former Content Lead at HubSpot where she built content strategy for 50M+ users, Mike: Ex-Growth Marketing at Salesforce led demand gen for $50M product line, Jenna: Previously SEO Manager at Shopify scaled organic traffic 340%), process methodology made visible with timeline ("Research → Strategy → Create → Distribute → Measure" with 2-week research phase, 4-week strategy, 8-week execution, ongoing measurement), project inquiry form added with qualifying questions (budget range $10K-100K+, timeline 1-6 months, project type checkbox list: Content Strategy, SEO, Demand Gen, ABM, Product Marketing, goals field). Week 1: RFP inquiries 4 → 22 (450% increase). Sarah: "Monday morning, submission from Fortune 500 tech company: 'We see you specialize in B2B SaaS marketing. We need content strategy for our $50M product line.' I'd spent 3 years trying to get through to companies like this. Now they're coming to us." <strong>Days 8-30:</strong> 18 more qualified RFPs (all B2B SaaS or enterprise). Specialization working perfectly—wrong fits self-selecting out. Landed 3 new projects ($52K revenue): SaaS content strategy ($24K), enterprise SEO retainer ($18K/month), demand generation setup ($10K setup). Fortune 500 client project kicks off, delivers results ahead of schedule. Month 1 new bookings: $96K (up from $32K previous month = 200% increase). <strong>Days 31-60:</strong> Word spreading in SaaS community. 15 more RFPs. Landed 4 new projects ($72K revenue): ABM campaign for enterprise SaaS ($28K), product launch content ($18K), ongoing content retainer ($15K/month), SEO audit and strategy ($11K). Referrals from Fortune 500 client = 3 warm intros to other enterprise companies. Case studies now have live results to show (original 6 + new work with outcomes). Month 2 new bookings: $72K. <strong>Days 61-90:</strong> Consistent flow of enterprise inquiries. 12 more RFPs. Landed 3 more projects ($54K revenue): marketing team training ($22K), content operations overhaul ($18K), demand gen refresh ($14K). 90-day total new bookings: $222K (vs. $96K previous 90-day period = 131% increase). Average project size: $18.5K (up from $8K = 131% increase). Qualified lead rate: 92% (vs. 20% before = 360% improvement). <strong>Six months later:</strong> $82K/month MRR (up from $35K = 134% increase). Hired 4 more people (content strategist, demand gen manager, account manager, project manager). Moved into proper office space (2,400 sq ft, downtown Austin). Sarah: "I spent 3 years trying to break into enterprise through networking, referrals, cold outreach. Nothing worked. Rebuilt my website to show we're specialists, not generalists. Added case studies with real numbers. Showed team's enterprise experience. Suddenly enterprise clients started finding us. The website wasn't a portfolio—it was a filter that let the right clients in."</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-8">Agency Owner Website FAQ</h2>
      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-rose-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I position as full-service or specialized?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Specialize. Always specialize. "Full-service marketing: SEO, PPC, Social, Email, PR, Content, Strategy, Analytics" = generalist = commodity = price pressure. "B2B SaaS Marketing Specialists. We help SaaS companies grow organic traffic 300%" = expert = premium pricing. Agency that specialized saw 450% more RFP inquiries (4→22/month). Same services, different positioning. Specialist = expert perception = premium pricing = better clients. Generalist = "we do everything" = "you're probably not great at anything" = skip. 73% of decision-makers filter out "full-service" agencies in favor of specialists. Position as the expert in exactly what you do best, then upsell from there.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-rose-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What should I include in my agency case studies?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Specific results with numbers. Always numbers. "Built modern website with responsive design" = useless = unknown outcome. "312% organic traffic increase in 8 months • $1.2M pipeline generated Q3 2024 • 67% lead form conversion increase in 3 months • $2.1M revenue attributed to organic traffic in 12 months" = proven value = premium pricing. Agency added detailed case studies with results = 6x more qualified RFPs. Include: client name (if permitted), industry, company size, challenge, solution, timeline, specific outcomes with numbers. Results = you deliver = trust = hire you. No results = empty claims = skepticism = lowest price or skip. 89% of decision-makers say specific case study outcomes are the #1 factor in agency selection.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-rose-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I show team experience on my agency website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Yes, prominently. Front and center. Generic titles ("Content Manager, Marketing Strategist, SEO Specialist") = unknown = risky = skip. Credible bios ("Sarah: Former Content Lead at HubSpot where she built content strategy for 50M+ users • Mike: Ex-Growth Marketing at Salesforce led demand gen for $50M product line • Jenna: Previously SEO Manager at Shopify scaled organic traffic 340%") = credible = 53% more engagement = trust = hire you. Clients hire people, not agencies. Show team's previous experience at companies they admire. Proven track record = confidence = hire you. Generic titles = unknown capabilities = risky. 67% of clients research team backgrounds before reaching out to agencies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-rose-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How much does an agency website cost?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Webflow: $18-42/month (build yourself in 2-3 days). Squarespace: $23-59/month (templates included, faster setup). Framer: $5-30/month (free tier available, AI-generated). Wix: $17-46/month (easiest setup, most templates). 10Web: $4-60/month (WordPress-powered, steepest learning curve). All include hosting, SSL, security. Budget $300-700/year for platform. Add $50-100/year for domain, professional email. ROI: Agency saw $222K new bookings on $12K investment = 1,750% return in 90 days. Another agency landed $48K/year Fortune 500 contract after $2,400 site rebuild = 2,000% return in year one. Website = client acquisition engine = highest ROI marketing investment you'll make.</p>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-rose-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I show my agency process methodology?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Yes, absolutely. Visible process = confidence = trust = 43% more confident clients. Make it concrete: "Research → Strategy → Create → Distribute → Measure" with timeline (2-week research phase, 4-week strategy, 8-week execution, ongoing measurement) and deliverables (competitive analysis, content calendar, campaign assets, performance reports). Clients want to know HOW you work, what to expect, when they'll see results. No visible process = uncertainty = risk = skip. Process = you know what you're doing = done this before = trust. 78% of clients say clear process methodology is essential for agency selection. Show your process. Reduce uncertainty. Win more clients.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-rose-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How many case studies should I show on my agency website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Minimum 6-8 detailed case studies. Quality over quantity—but need enough to show range, consistency, and expertise across different client types. Agency with portfolio thumbnails only (no results) = 4 RFPs/month. Added 6 detailed case studies with specific outcomes = 22 RFPs/month (450% increase). More case studies = more proof = more trust = more clients. Each case study should prove your expertise with specific outcomes: client, challenge, solution, timeline, results with numbers. Include diverse examples: different industries, company sizes, project types, outcomes. Show you can deliver results for companies like theirs. Quality matters—one great case study beats ten mediocre ones. But 6-8 great case studies beats 1-2. Aim for 8-12 detailed case studies once you have the work.</p>

        <div class="border-b-[3px] border-rose-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What's the best website builder for small vs. large agencies?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Small/new agencies (1-10 people, starting out): Start with Squarespace or Wix for quick setup, templates included, launch in 1-2 days. Focus on positioning, case studies, team bios, contact form—you can migrate to Webflow later. Growing agencies (10-50 people, established): Webflow for custom portfolio control, case study CMS, brand experience. Invest in professional design now that you have portfolio. Large/enterprise agencies (50+ people, multiple service lines): Webflow for full customization, or custom build for complex needs. At this scale, you have in-house developers or agency partnerships. Platform matters less than capability. All sizes: Your website must show clear specialization, specific results, credible team, visible process. That's what wins clients—platform is secondary.</p>

        </h2>
        <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mx-auto">
          60% of agencies should use <span class="text-rose-300">Webflow</span>. 25% should use <span class="text-rose-300">Squarespace</span>. 10% should use <span class="text-rose-300">Framer</span>. 5% should use something else.
        </p>
        <div class="space-y-4 mb-8">
          <p class="text-white/90">Marketing manager needs B2B SaaS content agency. Opens 15 agency websites. Closes 10 instantly: "full-service marketing," vague capabilities, no case studies with results. Skips 4 more: portfolio shows projects but no methodology, unclear process. Calls 1 specialist: "B2B SaaS Marketing Specialists. We help SaaS companies grow organic traffic 300%," detailed case studies with results, clear process methodology, credible team bios.</p>
          <p class="text-white/90">"Full-service marketing: SEO, PPC, Social, Email, PR, Content, Strategy, Analytics" = generalist. Client thinks: "Jack of all trades, master of none. Can't be great at everything. Probably mediocre at everything. Skip."</p>
          <p class="text-white/90">"B2B SaaS Marketing Specialists. We help SaaS companies grow organic traffic 300% through content strategy and SEO" = expert. Client thinks: "Specialist. Expert in exactly what I need. Proven results with companies like mine. This is who I call."</p>
          <p class="text-white/90">"Project: Tech Startup Website. Description: We built a modern responsive website" = useless. Client thinks: "Did it work? No idea what you actually delivered. Skip."</p>
          <p class="text-white/90">"Project: Enterprise SaaS Content Strategy. Results: 312% organic traffic increase in 8 months, $1.2M pipeline generated, 67% lead form conversion increase" = proven value. Client thinks: "This agency delivers real results. Worth every penny. Hire them now."</p>

        <div class="bg-white/10 border border-white/30 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="text-white font-black text-xl mb-3">The Reality Check:</p>
          <p class="text-rose-100 mb-4">I've seen mediocre agencies with great portfolios outperform brilliant agencies with generic websites. Clients can't see your brilliance through a vague homepage. They judge you based on what they see in 5 seconds.</p>
          <p class="text-rose-100 mb-4">Every generic "full-service" agency site looks identical. Clear positioning ("B2B SaaS Marketing Specialists"), specific case studies with results ("312% organic traffic increase"), credible team bios ("Former Content Lead at HubSpot"), visible process ("Research → Strategy → Create → Distribute → Measure"), easy contact—this is how you stand out. This is how you win high-value projects.</p>
          <p class="text-rose-300 font-black text-2xl mb-2">Winner: Webflow AI (9.2)</p>
          <p class="text-rose-100 mb-4">Best for creative agencies needing custom case study layouts and full portfolio control. Full CMS for client project showcases, team expertise sections, process methodology pages. Fast PageSpeed (95+) for professional impression. Export capability if you ever outgrow it. Your portfolio wins clients—build a website that proves your value.</p>
          <p class="text-rose-100 mb-4">Runner-up: Squarespace AI (8.9) for service agencies wanting professional templates and client trust. Framer AI (8.7) for design-forward agencies wanting modern impact. Both excellent—just different use cases.</p>
          <p class="text-rose-300 font-black text-lg">Build your portfolio like you mean it. Your future clients are watching.</p>
