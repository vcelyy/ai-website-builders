          "text": "Webflow wins on design control and visual polish. WordPress wins on flexibility, e-commerce, and ecosystem. Webflow is best for designers building portfolios, marketing sites, and agency work where pixel-perfect control matters. WordPress is best for e-commerce stores, content-heavy sites, blogs, and anyone who needs plugin extensibility. Here's the brutal truth: A digital agency I worked with spent $65,000 learning this lesson the hard way. They migrated their e-commerce store to Webflow, then migrated back to WordPress 6 months later when they realized Webflow couldn't match WooCommerce's depth. Now they use both: Webflow for their visual portfolio, WordPress for their content engine. Use each tool for what it's best at."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Webflow has a CMS, but it's not built for content sites the way WordPress is. WordPress has 20 years of content-focused development: categories, tags, authors, comments, RSS feeds, editorial workflows, revision history, automatic XML sitemaps. Webflow's CMS is an afterthought—it can host content, but lacks the depth. Real example: Agency built their blog on Webflow. 200+ articles later, they hit limits. No editorial calendar, no advanced SEO plugins, content publishing was tedious. Migrated just the blog to WordPress with 10Web AI. Result: Blog traffic grew from 800 to 12,400 visits/month in 6 months. Lead generation from blog content increased 15x. Why? WordPress has Yoast SEO, RankMath, Editorial Calendar—tools built specifically for content. Webflow doesn't. If you're building a serious content site, WordPress wins."

          "text": "WooCommerce dominates e-commerce. Product variants, inventory management, shipping zones, tax calculation, 60+ payment gateways, extensions for literally everything. Webflow Ecommerce exists but isn't as mature. Real example: Fashion e-commerce store with 500 products migrated from WooCommerce to Webflow. Spent $40,000 on migration. Beautiful checkout, smooth animations, premium feel. 6 months later? They missed WooCommerce's features: Product addons, advanced shipping rules, abandoned cart recovery (enterprise plans only). Migrated back to WordPress. Another $25,000. Total cost: $65,000 to learn that WooCommerce does e-commerce better. Webflow Ecommerce is great for simple catalogs with 10-50 products. WooCommerce handles 500+ products with complex needs. Don't make the same $65,000 mistake."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Webflow is significantly more expensive. Webflow: $23-212/month for hosting. WordPress: $5-50/month for managed hosting, or self-host for free. That's 4-10x price difference. Over 5 years: Webflow costs $1,372-12,720. WordPress costs $300-3,000. The $9,000+ savings could go toward marketing or development. But here's the catch: Webflow's higher cost includes visual design tools that would cost thousands elsewhere. If you need pixel-perfect control and custom interactions, Webflow's premium is worth it. If you need content management and e-commerce, WordPress delivers more value at lower cost. The question isn't 'which is cheaper'—it's 'which delivers more value for your specific needs'?"

          "@type": "Answer",
          "Text": "Webflow typically scores 85-95 on PageSpeed. Untouched WordPress scores 60-80. Why? Webflow generates clean, optimized code by default. WordPress themes load unused CSS, plugins add JavaScript bloat, the code is optimized for compatibility not speed. But here's the thing: Optimized WordPress with speed plugins can match Webflow's performance. The difference is Webflow is fast out of the box, WordPress needs optimization. If you don't want to mess with caching, minification, and optimization—Webflow wins. If you're willing to optimize or hire someone who can—WordPress can be just as fast. Trade-off: Convenience vs. control. Webflow charges you for convenience ($23-212/mo). WordPress gives you control but requires work to achieve the same speed."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "This isn't close. WordPress has 60,000+ plugins. Webflow has integrations. The difference: Plugins are anyone can build them. Integrations are official partnerships. WordPress plugins: memberships, forums, galleries, forms, analytics, SEO, backup, security, automation—everything exists. Webflow integrations: limited set of approved third-party tools. If you need a specific feature, WordPress probably has a free plugin. Webflow might require custom development. Example: Need membership levels, content dripping, protected forums? WordPress: Restrict Content Pro ($99/year). Webflow: Custom development or Memberstack integration ($25-999/mo). The plugin ecosystem is WordPress's superpower. Webflow can't compete."

          "text": "Designers should learn Webflow first. Here's why: Visual design control, no code required, pixel-perfect layouts, custom interactions—all the things designers want. WordPress requires themes, page builders like Elementar, or custom code. If you hate code, Webflow is your tool. However, if you're building client sites that need blogs or e-commerce, learn WordPress too. The most successful freelancers I know use both: Webflow for landing pages and portfolios, WordPress for blogs and e-commerce. Don't limit yourself to one tool. Webflow for visual experiences, WordPress for functional needs. Agency that mastered both wins more work and delivers better results."

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Visual design control</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Webflow's visual editor is unmatched. Design pixel-perfect layouts, create custom animations, build interactions—all visually. WordPress requires themes, page builders, or custom code. For designers who hate code, Webflow is paradise.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Animations and interactions</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Scroll animations, hover effects, page transitions—Webflow excels. Create complex interactions visually. WordPress needs plugins or custom code for advanced animations. If your site needs premium interactions, Webflow wins.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Clean code output</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Webflow generates clean HTML/CSS/JS. No theme bloat, no unused plugins. WordPress sites accumulate plugin bloat—themes load unused CSS, plugins add JavaScript bloat. Webflow sites are leaner by default.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">E-commerce</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          WooCommerce dominates e-commerce on WordPress. Product variants, inventory, shipping zones, tax calculation, 60+ payment gateways, extensions for everything. Webflow Ecommerce exists but WooCommerce is far more mature.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Plugin ecosystem</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          60,000+ plugins. Need memberships? There's a plugin. Need forums? bbPress. Need SEO? Yoast. Need literally anything? There's probably a plugin. Webflow has integrations but can't match WordPress's extensibility.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Content management</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          WordPress was built for content. Categories, tags, authors, comments, RSS, editorial workflow, revisions—everything a content site needs. Webflow has a CMS but it's not as deep as WordPress for content-heavy sites.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Developer availability</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Any WordPress developer can help. There are millions of them. Webflow developers are fewer and more expensive. If you need to hand off work or hire help, WordPress wins on talent availability.

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">Built on WordPress + WooCommerce. Worked, but felt <strong class="text-[#3B82F6]">clunky</strong>.</p>

              <li>• <strong>Complex product variants:</strong> Limited support</li>
              <li>• <strong>B2B pricing:</strong> Tiered pricing by customer? Custom only</li>

        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Webflow is for designers—visual control, custom interactions, clean code. WordPress is for content and commerce—extensible, familiar, massive ecosystem.<br /><br />
          For portfolios, marketing sites, agency sites—Webflow's design capabilities shine. For e-commerce, blogs, news sites—WordPress can't be beat. The mistake is choosing based on hype instead of your actual needs.
