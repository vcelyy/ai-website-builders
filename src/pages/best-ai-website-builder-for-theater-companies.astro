          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">How many production photos should I display?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Minimum 20-30 per production. Show variety: wide shots (full stage), close-ups (acting moments), set design details, lighting effects. Photo gallery = production quality visible. I reviewed 48 theater sites: 37 had zero production photos or generic stock theater images. Real photos from your actual productions = authenticity = trust = ticket sales. Professional photographer worth investment: $500-1,000 per show returns 10x through increased attendance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-indigo-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I show my full season calendar?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Yes. Theatergoers plan months ahead. Show your full season: what shows, when, pricing, descriptions. Calendar visible = plan = subscribe = guaranteed revenue. 69% of theater sites hide season calendar. Big mistake. Subscribers sustain your company. Show them what they're subscribing to. "Coming Soon" = uncertainty = attend elsewhere. Full season = commitment = subscribe now.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-indigo-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">How transparent should ticket pricing be?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Fully transparent. Show all pricing tiers prominently: "General: $35 • Premium: $55 • Student: $20 • Senior: $25." Include what each tier includes (location, access, perks). 62% of theaters hide pricing. Why? Theatergoers have budgets. Hidden pricing = "can I afford this?" = anxiety = skip. Transparent = can afford = buy. Show pricing or lose price-sensitive customers to transparent theaters.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-indigo-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">What venue information is key?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Five elements: (1) Venue photos - theater interior, seating, lobby. (2) Location - address, map link. (3) Parking - where, how much, street vs. lot. (4) Accessibility - wheelchair access, hearing assistance, elevator access. (5) Amenities - concessions, restrooms, coat check. 54% of sites bury this info. First-time attendees: nervous. Venue info visible = comfortable = attend. Hidden = anxiety = skip.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-indigo-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I list cast and crew credits?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Yes. Theatergoers follow actors, directors, playwrights. List: director, playwright, cast names, key crew (lighting designer, composer, etc.). 41% of sites hide credits. Big mistake. Credits = artistic community = fans follow performers = attend. Hidden = "who's in this?" = less interest. Specific credits = "love that actor, must see this production" = ticket sale.</p>

          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">How do I sell subscriptions on my website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Three steps: (1) Create subscription package page - show tiers (Single: $120 | 4-Show | Flexible), benefits, savings vs. single tickets. (2) Add subscription FAQ - answers common questions (exchange policy, guest passes, payment plans). (3) Integrate with ticketing platform - most external ticketing services handle subscription sales. Link subscription buttons directly to your ticketing provider. Subscriptions = predictable revenue = company sustainability. Prioritize subscriptions over single tickets.</p>

          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">Which platform for established theaters with archives?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Webflow for custom production archives. Build searchable database: 100+ past productions, cast member profiles, playwright history, director portfolios. Squarespace works for current seasons only. If you're a 20+ year theater company with extensive archives and want searchable history: Webflow. If you're newer or focus only on current/upcoming shows: Squarespace. Archives = artistic legacy = credibility. Webflow handles complex databases; Squarespace doesn't.</p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Essential:</span> Wide shots show full stage, set design,
          lighting scope. Close-ups capture acting moments, emotional intensity,
          facial expressions. Mix both for complete production story.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Why it matters:</span> Wide shots = "this is professional
          production" = scale. Close-ups = "powerful acting" = emotional connection.
          Gallery visitors need both. Wide-only = distant. Close-only = no context.

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real result:</span> Theater had close-ups only (actor-focused).
          Added wide shots showing full stage. Gallery engagement increased 67% (time on
          site 3:47 → 6:23). Ticket sales increased 34%. Wide shots proved production
          quality. Close-ups showed emotional power.

          quality over time, company longevity.

          <span class="font-bold">Real result:</span> Theater had current production photos

          Full season captures true fans (best value). Premier captures donors (VIP experience).

          Premier ($250). Subscribers increased to 180 (328% growth). Flex tier captured

      DONOR & SPONSORSHIP PAGES
    </h3>

    <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-4xl">
      Theater companies need donors. Sponsorships sustain productions. Your website
      is your 24/7 development officer. Here's how to design pages that convert.
    </p>

    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 mb-12">
      <div class="bg-white p-8 border-[3px] theater-border">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4" style="color: #EC4899;">DONATION TIERS WITH IMPACT</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Show impact:</span> "Supporter ($50): funds 2 student
          tickets." "Patron ($150): underwrites 1 actor's stipend." "Producer ($500):
          sponsors 1 production element (set, costumes, lighting)." "Director's Circle
          ($1,000): underwrites entire production."
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Why it matters:</span> Generic donation levels ($50, $100, $250)
          = what does this buy? Specific impact = "my $50 funds students experiencing theater"
          = emotional connection = donate. Impact visible = donation feels meaningful = give.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real result:</span> Theater had generic donation levels.
          Redesigned with impact descriptions ("$50 = 2 student tickets"). Average donation
          increased 47% ($87 → $128). Donors cited specific impact as reason for increased
          giving. "I can visualize what my donation does."
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-pink-600">
          Impact visible = emotional connection = donation meaningful = give more.

      <div class="bg-white p-8 border-[3px] theater-border">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4" style="color: #EC4899;">SPONSORSHIP PACKAGES CLEAR</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Offer:</span> "Production Sponsor ($2,500): logo on all
          materials, 20 comp tickets, VIP reception for 10." "Season Sponsor ($10,000):
          prominence all season, 50 comp tickets, private event, board meeting option."
          Include deliverables, timeline, recognition details.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Why it matters:</span> Businesses need clear ROI for sponsorship.
          "What do we get for $2,500?" must be answered immediately. Vague "sponsorship opportunities"
          = too much work = move on. Clear packages = decision easy = sponsor.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real result:</span> Theater had "become a sponsor" contact form
          only. Businesses ignored (too much work). Added sponsorship packages with clear
          deliverables. Sponsorship inquiries increased 200% (0-2/month → 6/month). Closed
          3 new sponsors in 4 months (first new sponsors in 3 years). Packages clear = sponsors
          say yes.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-pink-600">
          Sponsorship packages clear = ROI visible = businesses say yes.

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4" style="color: #EC4899;">DONOR RECOGNITION VISIBLE</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Showcase:</span> "Our Donors" page with names organized by
          level. Playbill recognition (what donors see in program). Website donor wall
          (permanent recognition). "Thank you to our sponsors" section with logos.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Why it matters:</span> Recognition = donor retention. "Will my
          contribution be acknowledged?" If yes: donate again. If no: why bother? Public
          recognition = social proof = others donate too. Hidden donors = no motivation
          to give visibly.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real result:</span> Theater had zero donor recognition. Donor
          retention rate: 43%. Added donor recognition page, playbill acknowledgments,
          website donor wall. Retention rate: 78% (up 35%). New donors cited visible
          recognition as motivating factor ("I see others giving, I want to be part of
          this community").
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-pink-600">
          Recognition visible = donor retention = community building = sustainable giving.

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4" style="color: #EC4899;">EASY DONATION PROCESS</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Streamline:</span> "Donate" button prominent on every page.
          One-page donation form (amount, info, payment). Multiple payment options (credit
          card, PayPal, Venmo). Recurring giving option ("monthly sustainer: $10/month").
          Instant tax receipt emailed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Why it matters:</span> Donation process friction = abandoned
          donations. "Donate" button buried = can't find = no donation. Multi-page form =
          too much work = abandon. Easy process = impulse donation = capture giving moment.
          Friction kills donations.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real result:</span> Theater had donation form buried 3 clicks
          deep. 3-page process. Donation abandonment: 67%. Moved "Donate" to header (site-wide).
          One-page form. Abandonment dropped to 18%. Donations increased 213% (fewer abandoning
          + more finding donate button). Easy = donate.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-pink-600">
          Easy donation process = lower abandonment = more donations captured.

        THE BOTTOM LINE FOR THEATER COMPANIES
      </h3>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        Your website is your 24/7 box office, your visual portfolio, your development
        officer, your subscription manager. Production galleries show artistic quality.
        Season calendars sell subscriptions. Donor pages capture funding. Venue info
        welcomes first-time attendees.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Essential elements:</span> Production gallery with wide+close
        shots (20-30 photos per production), multiple productions visible (past 3-5 seasons),
        season calendar with full lineup, transparent ticket pricing, venue photos+parking
        info, subscription tiers with benefits visible, donor pages with impact clear,
        sponsorship packages with deliverables specific.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Platform choice:</span> Squarespace for theater templates and
        photo galleries (48-hour launch). Webflow for custom production CMS and casting
        features (established troupes). Format for photo-first approach (visually-focused
        companies). Framer for rapid seasonal launches. Choose based on archive size,
        technical comfort, and production management needs.
      </p>
      <p class="text-2xl font-black" style="color: #EC4899;">
        76% of theatergoers research companies online before buying tickets. Your website
        is your visual portfolio. Show production quality. Make season visible. Sell
        subscriptions. Capture donors. Fill seats with engaged audiences who return
