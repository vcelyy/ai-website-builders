      <div class="mb-12">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What They Actually Do</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Relume generates sitemaps and wireframes. It answers "what pages do I need?" and "how should they be structured?" - all in minutes using AI.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Webflow builds the actual website. Design, animations, CMS, hosting - the full production package.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-12">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">AI Features</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Relume has solid AI. Describe your site, it generates a complete sitemap with pages, sections, and content structure. Webflow has zero AI.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          For planning phase, Relume is AI saves hours of manual sitemap work.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-12">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Workflow: Relume to Webflow</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Here is how they work together:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <li>Use Relume AI to generate sitemap (2 minutes)</li>
          <li>Refine pages and structure in Relume (10 minutes)</li>
          <li>Export to Webflow (one click)</li>
          <li>Design and build in Webflow (hours to days)</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Relume handles planning. Webflow handles execution. Combined workflow is powerful.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-12">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Export & Integration</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Relume exports directly to Webflow and Figma. The Webflow export includes pages, collections, and basic styling. You still need to design in Webflow, but structure is ready.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Webflow exports clean code (HTML/CSS/JS) or lets you host directly on their platform.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-12">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Pricing</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Relume has a free tier for small projects. Paid plans start around $20-30/month. Webflow starts at ~$23/month and scales up quickly.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Using both? Budget for Relume + Webflow. Not cheap, but powerful workflow.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">My Experience: The 90-Minute Planning That Prevented 3-Week Rework</h2>
          <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
          <div class="space-y-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A SaaS startup needed a 35-page marketing site. Product pages, pricing tiers, help documentation, blog, integrations, careers, contact. Complex information architecture. The founder wanted to start building immediately—"no time for planning, just build."</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The no-planning route (Webflow alone):</strong> Started building in Webflow directly. Spent 2 weeks building 18 pages. Client review: "User flow is wrong. Users can't find pricing. Help documentation is buried. Missing the integration showcase."</p>

            <div class="bg-teal-100 border-l-[4px] border-teal-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p class="text-sm text-teal-900 font-medium"><strong>The rework:</strong> Spent 1 week restructuring—deleting pages, reorganizing content, fixing user flows. Another week updating all the redesigned pages. Total time: 4 weeks. Site launched but everyone was exhausted. Design was beautiful but structure was rushed.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The planned route (Relume + Webflow):</strong> Same project, different approach. Started with Relume AI. Generated complete sitemap in 5 minutes—42 pages including pages the client forgot (careers, press, API docs, case studies). Spent 90 minutes reviewing sitemap with stakeholders. Found 3 missing pages during planning. Restructured based on feedback. Exported wireframes to Webflow instantly.</p>

            <div class="bg-cyan-100 border-l-[4px] border-cyan-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p class="text-sm text-cyan-900 font-medium"><strong>The result:</strong> Built in Webflow in 2.5 weeks following Relume's wireframes. Zero restructures needed. Client approved sitemap upfront, so no surprises. Total time including planning: 3.5 weeks. Same deliverable, less stress, smoother process.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bg-emerald-100 border-l-[4px] border-emerald-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p class="text-sm text-emerald-900 font-medium"><strong>The ROI:</strong> 90 minutes of planning saved 2 weeks of rework. At founder's €200/hour opportunity cost, that's €2,800 in savings. Plus, site launched 1 week earlier—generating revenue sooner.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="text text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The counter-scenario:</strong> A simple 8-page portfolio site. One designer, 2 weeks deadline.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>With Relume:</strong> Generated sitemap in 3 minutes. Spent 15 minutes refining. Client approved. Started building in Webflow immediately. Total time: 2 weeks exactly.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Without Relume:</strong> Started building in Webflow directly. Midway through, realized information architecture was wrong. Spent 3 days reorganizing. Had to cut features to meet deadline. Site launched but felt incomplete.</p>

            <div class="bg-lime-100 border-l-[4px] border-lime-500 p-4 my-4">
              <p class="text-sm text-lime-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Relume saves proportional to complexity. For simple sites (5-10 pages), you can skip planning. For complex sites (20+ pages), 90 minutes of Relume planning prevents weeks of rework.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="text text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> Webflow is a building tool, not a planning tool. It assumes you know what you're building. Relume is a planning tool that structures your thinking before you build. Together they're unbeatable. For complex projects, planning isn't optional—it's the difference between 3-week launches and 6-month reworks.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Final Verdict</h2>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <strong>Not an either/or choice</strong> - they are different tools for different phases.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <strong>Best workflow:</strong> Plan with Relume, build with Webflow. The AI-powered planning + powerful execution combo is hard to beat.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Start with Relume (free tier available). Export to Webflow when ready to build. If you only need one, Webflow for production, Relume for planning only.

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can Relume replace Webflow?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">No. Relume is for planning only. You still need Webflow (or Framer, Figma) to build the actual site.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How good is Relume to Webflow export?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Solid. Creates pages, collections, basic styling. You still need to design and polish in Webflow, but structure is ready.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Is Relume worth it if I use Webflow?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, if you value time. AI generates sitemaps in minutes that would take hours manually. Planning phase becomes trivial.</p>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I use Relume without Webflow?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. Relume exports to Figma too. Or use it purely for sitemap planning and build elsewhere.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Do professionals use this combo?</h3>
