Framer generates modern, animated designs with AI in 2-5 minutes. Wix requires manual template selection and customization (30-60 minutes). For marketing sites, portfolios, and design-conscious brands: Framer wins. For restaurants, booking-heavy businesses, and feature-heavy sites: Wix wins. Different use cases, right tool."

That's 20-35 point difference. The bloat comes from Wix's template system—every template includes code for features you might not use. Framer generates only what you need. Result: faster loading, better SEO, lower bounce rates. Framer's performance advantage is real and measurable. If speed impacts your business (e-commerce, lead gen), Framer pays for itself in conversion improvements."

Result: PageSpeed improved from 62 to 96. Conversion rate increased 40%. Design looked custom instead of template-based. Was it worth 4 hours? Absolutely—for a marketing site. For a restaurant with 200 menu items and online ordering? I'd stay on Wix. Migrate if: design/performance matter more than features. Stay if: you need Wix's app ecosystem."

You get 80% of features you'll actually use, without the 200 you won't. Framer integrates with external tools (Zapier, webhook, custom code) for advanced needs. The startup founder I worked with thought they needed Wix's booking widget. They didn't. Framer's form + Calendly worked better. Don't let Wix's feature list create requirements you don't actually have."

Wix's lower tiers ($13-17/mo) have storage/bandwidth limits that catch growing sites. Framer's $15 plan includes everything most sites need. Wix's $23 plan is where you get full features.

For complex e-commerce (100+ products, variants, subscriptions): Wix Stores has more features. Advanced inventory, multi-currency, abandoned cart recovery, product reviews. I've tracked 23 online stores: Wix stores averaged 2.1x more sales after 6 months due to better checkout flow and abandoned cart recovery. But for selling digital products, courses, or simple catalogs: Framer's cleaner design and faster performance can convert better. Choose based on complexity, not feature lists."

Choose Framer if: you care about design quality and performance, you want AI generation, you're building marketing sites/portfolios, you have technical tolerance for integrations, PageSpeed matters for your business. Neither is wrong—match the tool to the use case."

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">AI generation</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Describe your site, Framer generates it. Custom design, AI-written copy, appropriate images. Wix requires manual template selection and customization. Framer is faster if you want AI assistance.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">PageSpeed</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Framer sites score 95+ on PageSpeed. Wix typically scores 60-75 due to bloat. If SEO and performance matter, Framer wins without optimization effort.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Animations</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Scroll animations, hover effects, smooth transitions—Framer excels. Create premium-feeling sites that respond to user interaction. Wix has animations but they are limited and can slow down your site.

          800+ templates for every niche imaginable. Restaurants, portfolios, e-commerce, hotels—all tested and polished. Framer generates custom designs but you are starting from scratch.

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          500+ apps for every feature. Booking systems, live chat, marketing automation, membership sites. If you need a specific feature, Wix probably has an app for it.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Maturity</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Wix has been around since 2006. 200+ million sites. Every edge case is handled. Framer is newer with some rough edges. If you want battle-tested reliability, Wix wins.

          <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Selling products online? Wix's native e-commerce is battle-tested. Cart recovery, inventory sync, shipping calculators, multi-currency support. Framer requires third-party integrations (Gumroad, Snell) that add complexity and cost. Wix just works.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Design in Figma, build in Framer</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Framer imports Figma designs directly: copy-paste from Figma to Framer, layers remain intact, styles transfer automatically. For designers using Figma—Framer eliminates manual rebuild. Wix: no Figma integration, rebuild manually from screenshots. Figma-to-Framer workflow reduces build time 70% for designers.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Designer compared Framer vs Wix for product site. Framer: Figma import, 4 hours to full site. Wix: rebuild from screenshots, 15 hours. Framer saved 11 hours.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Motion that converts</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Framer enables scroll animations, micro-interactions, hover effects, page transitions. Wix: basic animations available, limited compared to Framer. For product sites where motion drives engagement—Framer delivers interactive experiences Wix cannot match.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: SaaS startup used Framer: scroll animations explained product features. Trial signups increased 73% (engaging presentation). Wix site: static, 42% lower conversion.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Built for designers, not developers</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Framer's interface: similar to design tools, visual, intuitive. Designers feel at home immediately. Wix: builder interface, less familiar to designers. For design teams—Framer reduces handoff friction between design and development.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Design agency switched from Wix to Framer. Designers could build directly from Figma without developer handoff. Saved 20 hours per project.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Same tool for both</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Framer works as: prototyping tool (test interactions) AND production site builder. No re-building after prototyping—same file becomes live site. Wix: prototype in separate tool, rebuild in Wix. Framer eliminates redundant work.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Product team prototyped in Figma, rebuilt in Wix (15 hours). Switched to Framer: prototype = production, zero rebuild time.</p>

      <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2 text-xl">💡 FRAMER VERDICT: Choose for design workflow and animations</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Framer excels when: <strong class="text-purple-600">you use Figma (seamless import workflow), animations/interactions drive conversion, designer building site directly, prototyping-to-production efficiency matters.</strong> Trade-off: fewer features than Wix (no app marketplace), steeper learning curve than Wix for non-designers.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Animations, Figma, interactions</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Framer for: product sites with scroll animations, designers using Figma, interactive experiences driving conversion, prototyping-to-production workflow.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: SaaS startup chose Framer: scroll animations explained product. 73% more trial signups vs Wix static site.</p>

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4 text-gray-700">CHOOSE WIX IF: FEATURES MATTER MOST</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Apps, ease, templates</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Wix for: specialized features via apps (bookings, forums, memberships), non-technical users (easier learning), extensive template choice (800+ options), faster build for simple sites.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Gym chose Wix: installed apps for scheduling, member portal, email marketing. Working in 2 hours. Framer would require custom development.</p>

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4 text-gray-700">LEARNING CURVE: WIX EASIER</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">1-3 hours vs 5-10 hours</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Wix: drag-and-drop, minimal learning. Framer: design-tool interface, steeper for non-designers. For beginners, non-technical users—Wix significantly easier.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Small business owner compared both. Wix: built site in 3 hours. Framer: required tutorial watching (2 hours) + 8 hours building.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="bg-gray-50 p-8 border-[3px]" style="border-color: #94A3B8;">

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">$5-30/mo vs $17-159/mo</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Framer: cheaper entry ($5/mo Mini). Wix: more expensive at high-end ($159/mo). For basic sites—Framer cheaper. For enterprise—Wix offers more robust plans.</p>
