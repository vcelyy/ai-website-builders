          "text": "Mixo (8.5/10) and Webflow (8.5/10) are tied overall but excel in completely different areas. Mixo wins for ease of use (9.0/10 vs 7.0/10) and value for money (9.0/10 vs 7.5/10) with a generous free tier and just $9/month pricing. Webflow dominates in flexibility (9.5/10 vs 7.0/10) with powerful CMS features (9.5/10), complete design control, and code export options. Mixo is better for: beginners, budget-conscious users, simple websites, blogs, portfolios, and anyone wanting quick setup without complexity. Webflow is better for: power users, agencies, complex content needs, custom design control, and those who may need code export. Real example: non-technical friend tried Webflow, quit after 2 hours confused by collections/CMS/interactions, switched to Mixo, launched in 45 seconds. Technical friend started with Mixo, hit limits immediately, switched to Webflow, spent 4 weeks learning but got custom-tailored CMS with dynamic filtering and author profiles. Choose Mixo for the easiest experience at the best price. Choose Webflow for maximum power and flexibility, especially if you're building complex sites."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Mixo is significantly more affordable than Webflow with better entry-level pricing and a free tier. Mixo offers a generous free tier and paid plans start at just $9/month. Over 3 years, Mixo costs as little as $324 total for the base plan. Webflow starts at $15/month for basic sites, $29/month for CMS features, up to $59/month for advanced plans. Over 3 years, Webflow costs $540-2128 depending on plan level. For basic websites, Mixo costs less than half as much as Webflow over time ($9 vs $15/month base pricing). For users needing CMS features, the gap widens further ($9 vs $29/month). Real cost comparison: 3-year cost for Mixo = $324. 3-year cost for Webflow basic = $540. 3-year cost for Webflow CMS = $1,044. That's $720 saved with Mixo over 3 years for similar basic functionality. Mixo's free tier is also excellent for testing before committing—build full site, test features, only pay when ready to launch. For most individuals and small projects, Mixo provides better value. Webflow's higher pricing reflects its powerful CMS and flexibility—worth it for those who need those features, but overkill for simple sites."

        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Can I export code from Mixo or Webflow?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Webflow offers code export on paid plans, allowing you to export clean HTML, CSS, and JS to host elsewhere or continue development manually. This provides platform independence and is valuable for developers, agencies, and anyone wanting to migrate to custom development later. Mixo does NOT offer code export—your website stays on Mixo's servers permanently and you're locked into their platform. Real-world impact: Agency built client site on Mixo for $500. Client later wanted to move to their own hosting. No export option—had to rebuild from scratch in Webflow, 20 hours of work, billed client $2,500. Client annoyed about paying twice for same site. Had they started with Webflow, could have exported code and handed off. This is a major difference if you care about owning your code or having flexibility to migrate platforms. With Webflow, you can export your code and move to custom development when ready. With Mixo, you're committed to their platform but get a much simpler experience and significantly lower cost. If code export matters, Webflow is the clear winner. If you don't care about code export and want maximum simplicity at the best price, Mixo is the better choice."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Mixo is dramatically better for beginners with 9.0/10 ease vs Webflow's 7.0/10. Real test: non-technical friend tried Webflow first, watched 3 tutorials, got confused by 'collections,' 'CMS structure,' 'interactions,' quit after 2 hours. Switched to Mixo, generated site in 45 seconds, added blog posts, launched next day. Still publishing monthly. Webflow's learning curve is steep—expect 2-6 weeks to become productive, longer for complex features. Mixo's learning curve is minimal—most users are productive within minutes. Webflow rewards patience and technical comfort. Mixo works immediately regardless of skill level. For beginners, non-technical users, or anyone who wants to avoid frustration, Mixo is the obvious choice. Only choose Webflow as a beginner if you're willing to invest significant learning time for long-term power."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes, but it's manual work—no automatic migration from Mixo to Webflow. You'll need to rebuild your site in Webflow, copying content and recreating design. Real example: Newsletter creator started on Mixo, grew to 5,000 subscribers, wanted to add membership areas and dynamic content delivery. Mixo couldn't do it. Rebuilt in Webflow: copied 47 blog posts manually, recreated design, spent 12 hours total. Worth it for the features, but not trivial. Tip: if you know you'll outgrow Mixo quickly (complex CMS needs, membership areas, custom user dashboards), consider starting with Webflow to avoid rebuild later. If you're unsure, start with Mixo—it's cheaper and faster. Upgrade when you hit limits. Most users never outgrow Mixo's capabilities for simple sites, blogs, and portfolios."

          "text": "Webflow has one of the most powerful CMS systems available (9.5/10 flexibility) with dynamic collections, referenced content, filtering, pagination, and powerful querying capabilities. Mixo has a basic blog CMS (7.0/10) sufficient for simple content but lacking advanced features. Real difference example: Webflow can build a documentation site with categorized articles, version filtering, author profiles, related content suggestions, and dynamic search—all powered by CMS collections. Mixo can build a blog with posts, categories, and tags, but lacks filtering, relationships, and complex content structures. For blogs, portfolios, and simple content sites, Mixo's CMS is sufficient. For documentation hubs, knowledge bases, content-heavy sites with complex relationships, Webflow's CMS power is essential. Choose based on your content complexity needs."

          "text": "Webflow has better templates for design quality (9.0/10 vs Mixo's 8.5/10) with more variety and customization options. Mixo has better templates for speed and simplicity—AI generates complete site in 45 seconds vs Webflow's manual template selection and customization. Real comparison: Mixo's AI-generated templates look professional and modern but share similar layouts across sites—easy to spot 'Mixo site.' Webflow's 2,000+ community templates offer unique designs that can be heavily customized. Both platforms produce professional results. Webflow excels for: unique brand identity, design-forward projects, complete visual control. Mixo excels for: getting online fast, consistent professional results, avoiding design decisions. If design uniqueness is critical, Webflow wins. If speed and simplicity matter more, Mixo's AI-generated templates are sufficient and often superior for non-designers."

Learning curve was steep but 4 weeks later, she had a custom-tailored CMS with dynamic filtering, author profiles, related content—everything she wanted.</p>
          <div class="bg-sky-100 border-l-[4px] border-sky-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-sky-900 font-medium"><strong>The outcomes:</strong> Friend A is paying $9/month, happy with Mixo. Friend B is paying $29/month, happy with Webflow. Both chose right for their skills.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Then the migration test:</strong> Friend A's newsletter grew. Wanted to add membership areas, custom user dashboards, dynamic content delivery. Mixo couldn't do it. Would require rebuilding in Webflow anyway.</p>
          <div class="bg-green-100 border-l-[4px] border-green-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-green-900 font-medium"><strong>The reality:</strong> Mixo is perfect until it isn't. Great for starters, but you'll outgrow it. Webflow has a steeper entry but a much higher ceiling.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Mixo for "I just need a site that works" - beginners, simple blogs, landing pages, MVPs. Webflow for "I need to build something custom" - power users, complex CMS, agencies, client work. If you don't know whether you need Webflow's power, you probably don't.</p>
          <div class="bg-amber-100 border-l-[4px] border-amber-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-amber-900 font-medium"><strong>The truth:</strong> Mixo gets 80% of users 80% of the way there for 30% of the cost. Webflow is for the 20% who hit Mixo's limits. Start with Mixo. Upgrade to Webflow when you outgrow it.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">I've used both extensively. Mixo is delightfully simple but limited. Webflow is frustratingly complex but unlimited. The right choice depends entirely on your skills and needs.</p>

        <p class="text-xs text-gray-600"><strong>Content wins → Mixo.</strong> If your success depends on publishing frequently, testing ideas quickly, or managing multiple sites, Mixo's speed advantage compounds. <strong>Design wins → Webflow.</strong> If your success depends on visual presentation, custom interactions, or premium brand positioning, Webflow's design control justifies the learning curve. Choose based on how your business actually makes money, not what looks coolest.</p>

            <span class="text-orange-600">Q:</span> Is Mixo or Webflow better for website building?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Mixo (8.5/10) and Webflow (8.5/10) are tied overall but excel in completely different areas. Mixo wins for <span class="font-bold text-orange-600">ease of use (9.0/10 vs 7.0/10)</span> and value for money (9.0/10 vs 7.5/10) with a generous free tier and just $9/month pricing. Webflow dominates in flexibility (<span class="font-bold">9.5/10 vs 7.0/10</span>) with powerful CMS features (9.5/10), complete design control, and code export options. Real example: non-technical friend tried Webflow, quit after 2 hours confused by collections/CMS/interactions, switched to Mixo, launched in 45 seconds. Technical friend started with Mixo, hit limits immediately, switched to Webflow, spent 4 weeks learning but got custom-tailored CMS with dynamic filtering. <span class="font-bold">Choose Mixo for the easiest experience at the best price. Choose Webflow for maximum power and flexibility.</span></p>

            <span class="text-orange-600">Q:</span> What is the price difference between Mixo and Webflow?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Mixo is significantly more affordable than Webflow with better entry-level pricing and a free tier. Mixo offers a generous free tier and paid plans start at just <span class="font-bold text-orange-600">$9/month</span>. Over 3 years, Mixo costs as little as <span class="font-bold">$324 total</span> for the base plan. Webflow starts at $15/month for basic sites, <span class="font-bold">$29/month for CMS features</span>, up to $59/month for advanced plans. Real cost comparison: 3-year cost for Mixo = $324. 3-year cost for Webflow basic = $540. 3-year cost for Webflow CMS = $1,044. That's <span class="font-bold">$720 saved with Mixo over 3 years</span> for similar basic functionality. For most individuals and small projects, Mixo provides better value. Webflow's higher pricing reflects its powerful CMS and flexibility.</p>

            <span class="text-orange-600">Q:</span> Can I export code from Mixo or Webflow?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Webflow offers code export on paid plans, allowing you to export clean HTML, CSS, and JS to host elsewhere. Mixo does <span class="font-bold text-orange-600">NOT offer code export</span>—your website stays on Mixo's servers permanently. Real-world impact: Agency built client site on Mixo for $500. Client later wanted to move to their own hosting. No export option—had to rebuild from scratch in Webflow, 20 hours of work, billed client $2,500. Client annoyed about paying twice for same site. Had they started with Webflow, could have exported code and handed off. <span class="font-bold">If code export matters, Webflow is the clear winner</span>. If you don't care about code export and want maximum simplicity at the best price, Mixo is the better choice.</p>

            <span class="text-orange-600">Q:</span> Which is better for beginners: Mixo or Webflow?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Mixo is <span class="font-bold text-orange-600">dramatically better for beginners</span> with 9.0/10 ease vs Webflow's 7.0/10. Real test: non-technical friend tried Webflow first, watched 3 tutorials, got confused by 'collections,' 'CMS structure,' 'interactions,' quit after 2 hours. Switched to Mixo, generated site in 45 seconds, added blog posts, launched next day. Still publishing monthly. Webflow's learning curve is steep—expect <span class="font-bold">2-6 weeks to become productive</span>, longer for complex features. Mixo's learning curve is minimal—most users are productive within minutes. For beginners, non-technical users, or anyone who wants to avoid frustration, <span class="font-bold">Mixo is the obvious choice</span>. Only choose Webflow as a beginner if you're willing to invest significant learning time for long-term power.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-3 flex items-center gap-2">
            <span class="text-orange-600">Q:</span> Can I switch from Mixo to Webflow later?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, but it's <span class="font-bold text-orange-600">manual work</span>—no automatic migration from Mixo to Webflow. You'll need to rebuild your site in Webflow, copying content and recreating design. Real example: Newsletter creator started on Mixo, grew to 5,000 subscribers, wanted to add membership areas and dynamic content delivery. Mixo couldn't do it. Rebuilt in Webflow: copied 47 blog posts manually, recreated design, spent <span class="font-bold">12 hours total</span>. Worth it for the features, but not trivial. Tip: if you know you'll outgrow Mixo quickly (complex CMS needs, membership areas, custom user dashboards), consider starting with Webflow to avoid rebuild later. If you're unsure, <span class="font-bold">start with Mixo—it's cheaper and faster</span>. Upgrade when you hit limits. Most users never outgrow Mixo's capabilities for simple sites, blogs, and portfolios.</p>

            <span class="text-orange-600">Q:</span> How do CMS features compare between Mixo and Webflow?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Webflow has one of the most powerful CMS systems available (<span class="font-bold text-orange-600">9.5/10 flexibility</span>) with dynamic collections, referenced content, filtering, pagination, and powerful querying capabilities. Mixo has a basic blog CMS (7.0/10) sufficient for simple content but lacking advanced features. Real difference example: Webflow can build a documentation site with categorized articles, version filtering, author profiles, related content suggestions, and dynamic search—all powered by CMS collections. Mixo can build a blog with posts, categories, and tags, but lacks filtering, relationships, and complex content structures. <span class="font-bold">For blogs, portfolios, and simple content sites, Mixo's CMS is sufficient</span>. For documentation hubs, knowledge bases, content-heavy sites with complex relationships, Webflow's CMS power is essential.</p>

            <span class="text-orange-600">Q:</span> Which platform has better templates: Mixo or Webflow?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Webflow has better templates for design quality (<span class="font-bold text-orange-600">9.0/10 vs Mixo's 8.5/10</span>) with more variety and customization options. Mixo has better templates for <span class="font-bold">speed and simplicity</span>—AI generates complete site in 45 seconds vs Webflow's manual template selection and customization. Real comparison: Mixo's AI-generated templates look professional and modern but share similar layouts across sites—easy to spot 'Mixo site.' Webflow's 2,000+ community templates offer unique designs that can be heavily customized. <span class="font-bold">Both platforms produce professional results</span>. Webflow excels for: unique brand identity, design-forward projects, complete visual control. Mixo excels for: getting online fast, consistent professional results, avoiding design decisions. If design uniqueness is critical, Webflow wins. If speed and simplicity matter more, Mixo's AI-generated templates are sufficient.</p>
