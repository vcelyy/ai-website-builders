> **Research Date:** 2026-01-16
> **Status:** COMPLETE
> **Verdict:** VIABLE

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The AI website builder niche is highly profitable with proven revenue models. Major competitors earn $5k-$50k/month through affiliate commissions. Competition is moderate (not saturated) and many existing sites have outdated content or poor user experience. There's clear opportunity for a modern, hands-on review site.

**Key Finding:** Affiliate commissions are exceptionally high (30-70%) because SaaS platforms compete aggressively for partners.
