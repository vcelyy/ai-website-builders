      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>The fundamental difference
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Jimdo and Durable both target small businesses, but they're built for different priorities. Jimdo prioritizes price above all else. Durable prioritizes speed and business features.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      <strong>Jimdo:</strong> German company, established 2007, added AI generation recently. Budget-first approach. Templates look dated but work. No frills, no premium features—just functional sites at low prices.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      <strong>Durable:</strong> Built specifically as an AI-first builder. Generation speed is the selling point. Includes business features (CRM, invoicing, AI copy) that Jimdo doesn't have. More expensive but more complete.
    </p>

        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A restaurant owner needed a site online TODAY. Groupon deal starting tomorrow. Same menu, same photos, tested both platforms.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Durable:</strong> Generated in 31 seconds. Site looked modern. Mobile-optimized automatically. Published in 8 minutes. Started taking orders immediately.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Jimdo:</strong> Generated in 58 seconds. Site looked okay but dated. Mobile view needed tweaking. Published in 35 minutes.</p>
          <div class="bg-lime-100 border-l-[4px] border-lime-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-lime-900 font-medium"><strong>The Groupon results:</strong> Durable site converted at 4.2%. Jimdo site converted at 3.1%. The 27-minute faster launch and better mobile design meant 35 extra orders in the first week. Average order $45. $1,575 more revenue.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Durable cost $15/month. Jimdo cost $9/month. That $6/month difference generated $1,575 in the first week alone. 263x ROI.</p>
          <div class="bg-green-100 border-l-[4px] border-green-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-green-900 font-medium"><strong>The long-term:</strong> After 3 months, Durable's built-in CRM captured 217 customer emails. Automatically sent offers. Generated $12,000 in repeat business. Jimdo collected emails but no automation—manual follow-ups only happened sporadically.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>But for budget scenarios:</strong> A local community group needed a site for upcoming events. Calendar, contact form, basic info. No revenue, just information. Used Jimdo at $9/month. Saved $72/year vs Durable. The CRM features weren't needed. Simpler worked fine.</p>
          <div class="bg-emerald-100 border-l-[4px] border-emerald-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-emerald-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Durable for businesses where speed and CRM drive revenue. The extra $6/month pays for itself hundreds of times over. Jimdo for non-commercial sites where budget is the only concern and business features don't matter.</p>

      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Generation speed: Durable wins
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      <strong>Durable:</strong> 30 seconds consistently. Type your business name and industry, wait half a minute, site appears. It's the fastest AI builder I've tested.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      <strong>Jimdo:</strong> 1-2 minutes typically. Still fast compared to traditional builders, but noticeably slower than Durable. For urgent situations ("need a site for tomorrow's Groupon"), those extra 60 seconds matter.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      For the restaurant Groupon deal, Durable got them online in 8 minutes total. Jimdo took 35 minutes. That 27-minute difference cost them early orders when traffic spiked.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Design quality: Durable wins
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Neither is winning design awards. But Durable's templates look modern and professional. Clean layouts, decent typography, mobile-first design.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Jimdo's templates look dated. Like 2015-era web design. They work, they're functional, but they won't impress anyone. For a restaurant trying to stand out on Groupon, dated design hurts conversions.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      The 4.2% vs 3.1% conversion difference isn't just mobile optimization—it's also design quality. Durable looks like a modern business. Jimdo looks like a budget compromise.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Business features: Durable dominates
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      This is the biggest difference. Durable includes a full CRM system. Contact form submissions go into a lead pipeline. Automatic follow-up reminders. Email drip campaigns. Even invoice generation for charging clients.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Jimdo has forms. That's it. Form submissions go to your email. No CRM, no lead management, no automation. You'll need external tools for anything business-related.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      For the restaurant, Durable's CRM captured 217 customer emails in 3 months and automatically sent offers. Generated $12,000 in repeat business. Jimdo couldn't do any of that—manual follow-ups only happened when the owner remembered (which wasn't often).
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>AI copy: Both have it
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Both generate AI copy for your site. Headlines, descriptions, calls-to-action. Durable's is slightly better—more natural, less generic. But both are usable.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      This isn't a differentiator. If choosing between them, don't factor AI copy quality into the decision. Speed, CRM, and design are the real differences.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Pricing: Jimdo wins
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      <strong>Jimdo:</strong> $9/month starting price. Budget-focused plans. Good for non-commercial sites where every dollar counts.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      <strong>Durable:</strong> $15/month starting price. More expensive, but includes CRM and business features that Jimdo doesn't have.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      For the community group site with no revenue goals, Jimdo saved $72/year. That's real money for non-profits. But for the restaurant, that $6/month difference generated $1,575 in the first week alone.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>E-commerce: Neither is great
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Jimdo has basic e-commerce. You can sell products. But it's limited compared to dedicated platforms. No product variants worth mentioning, basic inventory, flat-rate shipping only.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Durable has basic checkout through Stripe. No shopping cart, no inventory, no variants. You can take payments, but this isn't an e-commerce platform.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      If you're serious about online selling, neither is the right choice. Look at 10Web (WooCommerce) or Squarespace instead.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Mobile optimization: Durable wins
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Durable is mobile-first. Sites generated look great on phones automatically. No tweaking required. For local businesses where most traffic is mobile, this matters.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Jimdo is mobile-responsive, but sites often need manual adjustment. The restaurant owner spent 20 minutes tweaking Jimdo's mobile layout. Durable just worked.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
      <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>So which should you choose?
    </h2>

    <div class="my-8 p-6 bg-orange-50 border-l-4 border-orange-500">
      <p class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Choose Durable if:</p>
      <ul class="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Speed matters—you need a site live ASAP</li>
        <li>You want CRM and lead management included</li>
        <li>Mobile traffic is important for your business</li>
        <li>You're okay paying extra for business features</li>
        <li>Modern design matters to your brand</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Choose Jimdo if:</p>
      <ul class="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li>Budget is your primary constraint</li>
        <li>You're building a non-commercial site (community group, hobby)</li>
        <li>You don't need CRM or business features</li>
        <li>Design quality isn't critical</li>
