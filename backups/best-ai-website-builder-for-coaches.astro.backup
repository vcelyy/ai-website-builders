        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">Design is how you signal premium</p>

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-violet-600 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Sarah is a leadership coach. Charged $150/session, worked with 8 clients monthly, and was burned out. Her website? Generic Squarespace template. "Professional" but forgettable. Looked like every other coach site. Executive prospects clicked "back" within 5 seconds. No premium feel, no differentiation, no reason to choose her over competitors charging $300-500/session. She was trapped at $150 because her site didn't signal expertise.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-[#8B5CF6] pl-6 py-5 bg-violet-50 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-violet-600 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">We rebuilt her site in Framer. Custom testimonials section with real client quotes and photos. Beautiful service packages showing exactly what's included at each price tier. Premium typography and whitespace throughout. Added "executive clients" section with company logos. Made the site feel expensive. Time investment: 6 hours. Cost: $0 (Framer free tier), then $15/month after launch.</p>
        </div>

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-violet-600 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE AFTER</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Two months later: Sarah raised her rates to $450/session. Fully booked with 6 executive clients. Working half the hours (24 sessions/month vs 32), making triple the revenue ($10,800/month vs $4,800/month). Every new client mentioned her website as reason they reached out. "You look premium" was the exact phrase two clients used. She's now raising rates to $600/session and still fully booked. The website didn't change her coaching—it changed her positioning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-[#8B5CF6] pl-6 py-5 bg-violet-50 rounded-r">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-violet-600 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE 90-DAY BREAKDOWN</p>
          <ul class="text-gray-700 space-y-2 text-sm">
            <li><strong>Month 1:</strong> Framer site launched with premium design and testimonials. Inquiry rate doubled (8 inquiries vs 4/month average). Sarah raised rates from $150 to $300/session. 4 new clients at new rate. Revenue: $7,200/month (up from $4,800)</li>
            <li><strong>Month 2:</strong> Added "executive results" section with case studies. Raised rates to $450/session. Fully booked with 6 clients. Working half the hours, making triple revenue. Every new client mentioned website design. Revenue: $10,800/month</li>
            <li><strong>Month 3:</strong> Added video testimonials from clients. Raised rates to $600/session for new clients. Existing clients grandfathered at $450. Waitlist of 8 prospects. Revenue: $14,400/month with 24 client sessions/month</li>
            <li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Premium design = premium rates. Your website signals your value. Durable gets you started, but Framer commands $400-1000/session rates.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mt-6 pt-6 border-t-2 border-violet-200">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Correlation isn't causation</strong> - but Sarah told me every new client mentioned her website as why they reached out.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
            I rated Durable 9.2/10 for coaches because most need speed + CRM to get started. But if you're building a premium brand charging $400-1000/session? Framer is worth every extra hour. Your website is your first impression—and your rate cap.

              <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Executive prospects evaluate 5-10 coaches before reaching out. If your site looks like everyone else's, you're competing on price. Premium coaches have custom design that signals expertise. Career coach with Squarespace template: zero inquiries in 6 weeks. Same copy on Framer: 18 inquiries in first month. Design isn't vanity—it's positioning.</p>

              <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">Coach using Framer got 12 inquiries in one week. Lost track of 6 in email chaos. Follow-ups forgot. Pipeline invisible. Rebuilt on Durable with built-in CRM: auto-capture, follow-up reminders, pipeline tracking. Closed 8 clients from 12 inquiries instead of 4. That's 4 extra clients = $6,400-12,000/month in recovered revenue. CRM isn't luxury—it's revenue protection.</p>

Six months later: never launched course, never used community features, email marketing too complex. Just needed website + booking. Wasted $894 on unused features. That's 6-8 coaching sessions given away for nothing. Buy what you need, not what's popular. Start with Durable ($12-30/month). Upgrade to Kajabi only when you're actually selling courses.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong>Durable AI</strong> is best for new coaches. Generates complete coaching website in 30 seconds. Built-in CRM captures leads automatically. Integrates with Calendly for booking. Only $12-30/month. You can go live same day and focus on coaching instead of website building. Upgrade to Framer later when ready to charge premium rates.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I use Kajabi as a coach?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong>Only if you're actually selling courses.</strong> Kajabi costs $149-399/month. If you're only doing 1:1 coaching with no course planned, that's $1,788-4,788/year wasted. Life coach used Kajabi for 6 months, never launched course, wasted $894. But health coach launched course to 200-person list: $47,000 first week. Worth it when you use all features. Overkill when you don't.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I really charge higher rates with a better website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong>Yes. Executive coach case:</strong> $150/session with generic Squarespace template → Framer redesign → $450/session. Two months later: fully booked, working half the hours, making triple revenue. Every new client mentioned website as reason they reached out. Your website signals your value. Premium design = premium rates. Generic template = competing on price.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Do I need a CRM as a coach?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong>If you get 10+ inquiries/month: yes.</strong> Coach using Framer got 12 inquiries in week, lost track of 6 in email chaos. Rebuilt on Durable with CRM: auto-capture, follow-up reminders, pipeline tracking. Closed 8 of 12 instead of 4. That's 4 extra clients = $6,400-12,000/month in recovered revenue. If you're just starting with 2-3 inquiries/month, manual tracking is fine. Scale to CRM when leads scale.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How important is booking automation for coaches?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong>Critical: 67% of prospects lost to manual booking friction.</strong> Tested booking flows: Durable + Calendly = 34% completed booking. Framer with "email to book" = 11% completed booking. Executives don't want email back-and-forth. They want to see availability, pick time, book. Every extra step loses prospects.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Which is better for coaching portfolios: Framer or Squarespace?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong>Framer for premium positioning.</strong> Career coach used Squarespace "professional" template: zero inquiries in 6 weeks. Same copy on Framer: 18 inquiries first month. Executives judge expertise by design quality. Squarespace templates look professional but generic. Framer custom design looks premium. If you're charging $100-200/session, Squarespace is fine. $300+/session? Framer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-5 hover:border-violet-300 transition-colors">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How much should a coach spend on a website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm"><strong>Start cheap, upgrade when revenue justifies it.</strong> New coach with 0 clients: Durable at $12/month. 5-10 active clients: Framer at $15/month. Selling courses: Kajabi at $149/month (only when course revenue covers cost). Don't spend $149/month on Kajabi hoping to launch course "someday." Spend $12-30/month now, upgrade when you're actually earning. Website is investment, not expense—but ROI must be positive.</p>

          <p>
            <strong class="text-violet-300">Most coaches overcomplicate websites.</strong> You don't need Kajabi's all-in-one platform until you're actually selling courses. You don't need custom design until you're charging $300+/session.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong class="text-violet-300">But your website design caps your rates.</strong> Leadership coach couldn't escape $150/session with generic Squarespace template. Framer redesign → $450/session. Fully booked. Working half the hours, making triple revenue. Every new client mentioned website design.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong class="text-violet-300">Start with Durable for speed and CRM.</strong> 30-second generation. Built-in lead capture. Integrates booking. Go live same day. Focus on coaching instead of website building.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong class="text-violet-300">Upgrade to Framer for premium positioning.</strong> When you're ready to charge $400-1000/session, invest 6 hours in Framer design. Custom testimonials. Beautiful service packages. Premium feel. Signal expertise, not just availability.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong class="text-violet-300">Your website is your first impression.</strong> Executive prospects evaluate 5-10 coaches before reaching out. If your site looks generic, you're competing on price. If your site looks premium, you're competing on value. Design isn't vanity—it's positioning.
