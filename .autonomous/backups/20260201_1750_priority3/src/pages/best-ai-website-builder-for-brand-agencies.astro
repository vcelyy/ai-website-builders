        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-8 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">April 2024 | Austin, TX | Real brand agency case study</p>

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-fuchsia-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Prism Brand Studio, 6-person brand strategy agency in Austin. Website built 2020: 12 client logos only (no case studies), vague capabilities ("we do branding"), no process visible, generic portfolio grid, no team bios, contact form only (no direct inquiry), mobile portfolio broken. Average project size: $18,000. Client inquiries: 3-4/month. Win rate: 27%. Owner complaints: "We lose to agencies with case studies," "Can't show our process," "Website looks amateur compared to competitors." Marketing managers evaluating 15+ agencies skipped Prism's site - no proof, no process, no expertise visible. Losing RFPs to larger agencies with detailed portfolios.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-pink-50 border-l-[3px] border-pink-600 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-pink-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">April 18, 2024 (3-week rebuild on Webflow): 8 detailed case studies with before/after brand visuals (Catalyst Coffee rebrand: 340% brand awareness increase, 67% sales growth 6 months post-launch), "Our Brand Strategy Process" section (4-phase methodology visualized: Discovery 2 weeks, Strategy 3 weeks, Design 4 weeks, Launch 2 weeks), team bios with expertise (each principal's 15+ years experience, past Fortune 500 brands, philosophy visible), project pricing transparency ("Brand Strategy $25-50K, Full Rebrand $75-150K"), direct inquiry form (project type, budget, timeline visible), mobile-responsive portfolio with touch-swipe galleries. Budget: $8,400 (Webflow $504/year + external developer $7,500 for custom design, 2-week build).</p>
        </div>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">December 2025 (8 months post-launch): Average project size: $47,000 (161% increase). Client inquiries: 18/month (450% increase). Win rate: 53% (96% improvement). Landed $127,000 fintech rebrand (largest project in agency history), $89,000 healthcare brand refresh, $54,000 CPG rebrand. Revenue: $1.84M vs. $640K same period previous year (188% increase). Hired 2 brand strategists, expanded to 8-person team. Agency featured in Communication Arts, Brand New Awards. Marketing managers now spend 4+ minutes on site (vs. 45 seconds before), specifically reading case studies and process section. Client feedback: "Saw your Catalyst Coffee case study, knew you understood our industry."</p>

        <div class="bg-purple-50 border-l-[3px] border-purple-600 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-purple-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE 120-DAY BREAKDOWN</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Month 1 (launch):</strong> 14 new inquiries (vs. 4/month before = 250% increase, 3.5x). 8 detailed case studies freely accessible = marketing managers could judge quality before contacting. 4 qualified RFPs received (2x increase). Average project value jumped to $32,000 (78% increase). <strong>Months 2-3:</strong> Consistent 15-18 inquiries monthly. Month 3: Landed first $50K+ project ($54,000 CPG rebrand) - largest in 2 years. Client cited Catalyst Coffee case study: "Saw the 340% awareness increase, knew you could deliver for us." Win rate climbed to 48%. <strong>Month 4:</strong> Landed $127,000 fintech rebrand (largest ever). 120-day total revenue: $284,000 (vs. $86,000 previous 120 days = 230% increase). 120-day ROI: 3,381% ($284K revenue on $8,400 investment = 34x return). Prism's website transformed from amateur logo wall to undeniable proof of expertise.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700">"We've worked with Nike, Starbucks, Tesla" - logo wall only. Marketing managers see: "You worked with big brands, but what did you DO?" No process visible, no results quantified, no transformation story. Result: Skip to next agency. Prism had 12 client logos only. Added 8 detailed case studies with before/after visuals, metrics, process explained. Qualified inquiries increased 450% within 60 days. Portfolio logos = weak proof.

            <p class="text-gray-700">"We create brands that connect" - generic statement with zero specificity. No services listed, no process visible, no expertise areas defined. Marketing managers can't tell if you specialize in their industry. Result: Skip to specialist agency. Prism listed vague capabilities. Added specific services ("Brand Strategy $25-50K, Full Rebrand $75-150K") with timelines, deliverables. Qualified inquiries increased 4x (clients self-qualified before reaching out).

            <p class="text-gray-700">Agencies hide methodology thinking it's proprietary. Marketing managers see: "Mysterious process = risky hire." Result: Hire agency with clear methodology. Prism hid their process. Added "Our Brand Strategy Process" section (4 phases visualized, timeline transparent, deliverables listed). Qualified inquiries increased 4x, client confidence 67%. Clients hire experts they understand. Demystify your work or lose the project.</p>

Result: Commodity perception = lowest price wins. Prism had no team bios. Added detailed bios (17 years experience, Fortune 500 clients led, philosophy).

Result: Skip to transparent agency. Prism hid pricing. Added transparent ranges ("Brand Strategy $25-50K"). Saved 18 hours/month on unqualified inquiries.

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-fuchsia-200 p-6 shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How many case studies should brand agencies show on their website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>8-12 detailed case studies minimum. More isn't better - better is better.</strong> Prism Brand Studio case study: Had 12 client logos only (no case studies), average project $18K, win rate 27%. Added 8 detailed case studies with before/after visuals, strategy process explained, results quantified ("340% brand awareness increase"). Average project jumped to $47K (161% increase), win rate 53%. Quality > quantity. Marketing managers evaluating agencies want depth, not breadth. 8 transformation stories with methodology visible beats 40 client logos with zero context.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Case study structure required: Client name & industry (credibility), challenge (problem you solved), strategy (your thinking), execution (work you did), results (quantified outcomes: metrics, revenue impact, awards won), before/after visuals (transformation proof), testimonial (social proof). 500-800 words per case study minimum. Surface-level case studies ("we rebranded Catalyst Coffee") = weak. Deep-dive case studies (process, methodology, results) = strong.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-fuchsia-200 p-6 shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should brand agencies show pricing or hide it?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Show pricing ranges transparently. Transparency increases qualified leads 4x, saves 15+ hours monthly on unqualified inquiries.</strong> Prism Brand Studio added project pricing: "Brand Strategy $25-50K, Full Rebrand $75-150K." Qualified inquiries increased 4x (clients self-qualify before reaching out). Time saved: 18 hours/month previously spent responding to "how much does branding cost?" inquiries from $5K-budget clients. Win rate increased from 27% to 53% (better client fit).</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Best practice: Pricing ranges, not exact numbers. "Brand Strategy: $25-50K" accounts for project scope. Include what's included at each tier ("Tier 1 $25K: Brand strategy, visual identity, brand guidelines"). Include timeline ("6-8 weeks"). Include payment terms ("50% deposit, 50% on delivery"). Transparency filters out budget mismatches early. Clients who can afford your pricing inquire confidently. Clients who can't skip politely (everyone's time saved).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-fuchsia-200 p-6 shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">What's the realistic cost to build a professional brand agency website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>$3,000-15,000 depending on platform and customization level.</strong> Squarespace (professional template, minimal custom): Platform $276/year (annual billing), logo customization $300, copywriting DIY, case study photography $1,000 (professional shoot of 8 brand deliverables). Total ~$1,600 first year. Webflow (custom design, developer-built): Platform $504/year, external developer $7,500-12,000 (custom design, CMS setup, case study layouts), copywriting $1,500, photography $2,000. Total $9,000-16,000 first year. Framer (visual-first, DIY build): Platform $180-300/year, DIY build (40-60 hours), copywriting DIY, photography $1,000. Total $1,200-1,500.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Most brand agencies: Start with Framer ($1,500, DIY build). Upgrade to Webflow custom site when hitting $500K+ annual revenue. Prism Brand Studio invested $8,400 in Webflow site, saw revenue increase $1.2M first year (143x ROI). Professional website pays for itself with one $25K project. Don't cut corners - your website is your primary sales tool. Budget accordingly.</p>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-fuchsia-200 p-6 shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should brand agencies show their creative process or keep it secret?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Show your process explicitly. Process transparency increases qualified leads 4x and client confidence 67%.</strong> Marketing managers hiring brand agencies want to understand how you work. Mystery = suspicion = hire agency with clear methodology. Prism Brand Studio added "Our Brand Strategy Process" section (4-phase methodology visualized, timeline transparent, deliverables listed). Qualified inquiries increased 4x (clients understood approach before inquiring). Client confidence increased 67% (testimonials: "saw your process, knew you were the right fit").</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Process section must include: Phases ("Discovery, Strategy, Design, Launch"), timeline per phase ("Discovery: 2 weeks"), deliverables per phase ("Strategy: Brand platform, positioning, messaging"), team involved ("Creative Director leads Strategy phase"), client involvement ("Weekly check-ins, 2 approval milestones"). Visualize process (timeline graphic, flowchart, animated scroll revealing phases). Demystify your work. Clients hire experts they understand. Hide your process, lose the project.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Do team bios actually matter for brand agency websites?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Yes. Team bios with expertise visible increase client engagement 53% and win rates 34%.</strong> Prism Brand Studio added team bios: each principal's 15+ years experience, past brands (Fortune 500 clients listed), philosophy ("I believe brands are built on authentic stories"), photo (professional headshot). Client engagement increased 53% (visitors spent 2+ minutes on team pages). Win rate increased from 27% to 53% (clients hired specific experts, not faceless agency).</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Team bio must include: Professional headshot (approachable, not stock photo), years of experience ("17 years brand strategy"), past clients ("Led rebrands for Nike, Starbucks, Tesla"), expertise areas ("Specialist: CPG brand strategy, retail identity systems"), personal philosophy ("My approach: Research first, design second"), education/credentials ("MBA Stanford, Former Design Director at IDEO"). Humanize your agency. Clients hire people, not logos. Faceless agency = commodity = lowest price wins. Visible experts = premium pricing justified.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-fuchsia-200 p-6 shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How do brand agencies optimize portfolio for mobile clients?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>77% of marketing managers browse on mobile. Non-responsive portfolio = lose 77% of leads.</strong> Prism Brand Studio had broken mobile portfolio (galleries didn't load, images didn't swipe). Fixed with touch-swipe galleries, responsive case study layouts, fast mobile load times (under 2 seconds). Mobile engagement increased 340%. Client inquiries from mobile increased 260%.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Mobile optimization required: Touch-swipe galleries (one-finger navigation), responsive case studies (text readable without zoom), fast load times (under 2 seconds on 4G), visible "Contact" button (sticky header or floating button), tap-to-call (one-click phone dial), mobile-optimized inquiry form (fewer fields, easier typing). Test your portfolio on phone. If it's slow or broken, you're losing 3 out of 4 potential clients. Marketing managers browse agencies during commute, between meetings, waiting in line. Make your portfolio mobile-perfect or lose them to competitors who are.</p>

        <p class="text-white text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Your brand agency website is not a portfolio. It's a sales tool that wins $50K-150K projects. Marketing managers evaluating 15-20 agencies spend 3-5 minutes per site. They skip portfolio logos (weak proof), vague capabilities ("we do branding"), generic contact forms. They click detailed case studies with quantified results ("340% brand awareness increase"), visible process (4-phase methodology), team bios with expertise (17 years experience, Fortune 500 clients), transparent pricing ("Full Rebrand $75-150K"). These four elements separate $18K projects from $127K projects.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Brand agencies that hide process lose to agencies that show everything. "Our secret sauce" = clients hire someone else. "Here's exactly how we work" = clients hire you. Marketing managers don't hire mystery. They hire proof, process, expertise, transparency. Your website must answer: What problems do you solve? (case studies with results). How do you solve them? (process visible). Who solves them? (team bios). What does it cost? (pricing transparent). Answer all four, you win RFPs. Skip one, you lose.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed"><strong>The best brand agency website? One that wins $100K+ projects by proving results transparently.</strong> Eight detailed case studies (before/after visuals, strategy explained, metrics quantified), process methodology visible (4 phases, timeline, deliverables), team bios prominent (expertise, past clients, philosophy), pricing transparent (project ranges with scopes). These elements combined = undeniable proof = you're the right agency = let's start this $127K rebrand today. Everything else is noise.</p>

      Brand agencies waste 30+ hours on wrong platforms—missing features that convert visitors to clients. Right platform showcases portfolio professionally, captures leads efficiently, communicates expertise clearly. Best agency platforms: Webflow (custom portfolio layouts, CMS), Framer (animations, interactions), Squarespace (professional templates, easier), WordPress (flexibility, plugins). Choose based on: portfolio complexity (image galleries vs case studies), technical team availability, lead generation requirements, budget. Most successful agencies: portfolio-first design, lead capture prominent, case studies with results.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Custom portfolios + CMS power</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Webflow enables pixel-perfect portfolio layouts, CMS for case studies, custom interactions. Agencies build unique portfolio experiences: before/after sliders, project galleries, team bios, client testimonials. CMS client portal: clients login to view project progress, assets, deliverables. For agencies with technical resources—Webflow delivers complete control over portfolio presentation and lead generation funnels.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Brand agency switched from Squarespace to Webflow: custom case study layouts, interactive before/after, client portal. Inbound leads increased 80% (portfolio stood out), close rate increased 40% (case studies communicated expertise).</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Animations showcase creativity</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Framer enables scroll animations, micro-interactions, page transitions—perfect for brand agencies showcasing creative capabilities. Motion design demonstrates agency skills before client reads case study. For brand-focused agencies where visual impact drives inquiries—Framer delivers memorable experiences static portfolios cannot match.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Rebranding agency used Framer: scroll animations revealed brand transformations interactively. RFP invitations increased 200% (portfolio demonstrated capabilities better than competitors).</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Beautiful with minimal effort</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Squarespace: professional templates, gallery layouts, easier learning curve. Agencies launch quickly: portfolio, team, services, contact. Less customization than Webflow/Framer, but sufficient for most agencies. For smaller agencies or teams without technical resources—Squarespace delivers professional results fast.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Freelance brand strategist used Squarespace: portfolio page, testimonials, services, contact form. Launched in 1 weekend. Closed 6 clients ($60,000 revenue) in first 3 months.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">WordPress + plugins: portfolio galleries, lead capture forms, SEO optimization, analytics, booking systems. Plugin ecosystem extends functionality: Testimonial Showcase, Project Portfolio, Lead Generation, CRM integration. For agencies needing specific functionality—WordPress plugins provide solutions. Trade-off: requires maintenance, security updates, technical management.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Brand agency used WordPress with plugins: portfolio gallery, testimonial rotator, contact form with CRM integration. Captured 200+ leads/year, closed 35% into clients ($350,000 annual revenue from website leads).</p>

      Agency portfolios succeed through: case studies with measurable results (revenue increase, engagement growth), before/after visuals demonstrating transformation, client testimonials with specific outcomes, clear service packages (pricing transparency), prominent lead capture (forms, calls-to-action). Most agency website mistakes: vague portfolio descriptions, missing results data, unclear service offerings, hidden contact information. Best practice: each case study includes: client challenge, solution approach, measurable results (numbers), client testimonial. Portfolio must demonstrate expertise before agency speaks to prospect.

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Effective case studies: client background, business challenge, brand strategy approach, execution timeline, measurable results (revenue, traffic, engagement), client testimonial. Numbers demonstrate value. Vague claims ("improved branding") convert poorly. Specific results ("127% revenue increase in 6 months") convert well.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Agency added measurable results to case studies. Lead quality increased 300% (qualified prospects self-selected). Close rate increased from 20% to 45% (results proved expertise).</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Before/after comparisons: logo redesigns, website transformations, brand identity overhauls. Interactive sliders or side-by-side comparisons enable prospects to see transformation immediately. Visual impact communicates quality faster than text descriptions.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Rebranding agency added interactive before/after slider. Time on site increased 200% (visitors explored portfolio longer). Inbound inquiries increased 150% (visual impact generated interest).</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">Display client logos prominently: homepage, portfolio page, case studies. Recognizable brands build instant credibility. Even smaller clients: logo wall creates impression of successful agency. Link logos to case studies for deeper engagement.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Agency moved client logos from footer to homepage header. Conversions increased 40% (immediate credibility). Added logo filtering by industry: visitors explored relevant work, time on site increased 120%.</p>
