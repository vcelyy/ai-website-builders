        Traditional builders require manual design. AI builders generate from prompts. Which approach is better?

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">The Difference</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <strong>Traditional:</strong> You pick a template, replace text, swap images, adjust layout manually. Takes 2-8 hours.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <strong>AI:</strong> You describe your business, AI generates a complete site. Takes 30 seconds to 2 minutes.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
        <strong>The reality:</strong> AI gets you 80% there in 2% of the time. But that last 20% of polish? Still takes time.
      </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">My Experience: 8 Hours of Traditional Building vs. 3 Minutes of AI</h2>
        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">I needed a landing page for a time-tracking tool I was building. Traditional approach: Wix template. AI approach: Durable AI.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Traditional (Wix):</strong> Picked template. Replaced placeholder text. Swapped stock images for screenshots. Adjusted sections. Tried to change button color - couldn't find the setting. Spent 30 minutes hunting for layout controls. Got frustrated with spacing - sections wouldn't align. After 3 hours, site was "okay" but not great. Spent another 5 hours tweaking. Total: 8 hours for "good enough."</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>AI (Durable):</strong> Typed: "Time-tracking tool for freelancers with features dashboard, pricing, testimonials." Waited 30 seconds. Site appeared. Generated copy was actually good. Layout was professional. Changed brand colors in 2 clicks. Total time: 3 minutes.</p>

          <div class="bg-orange-100 border-l-[4px] border-orange-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-orange-900 font-medium"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> Wix site looked slightly more "polished" after 8 hours. Durable site after 3 minutes was 90% as good. The extra 10% of polish took 7 hours and 57 minutes extra. Was it worth it? For a time-tracking tool launching to test product-market fit - absolutely not.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-amber-100 border-l-[4px] border-amber-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-amber-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Traditional builders give you control. AI builders give you speed. For launching quickly, AI wins. For pixel-perfect custom designs, traditional wins. But here's the thing: 90% of businesses don't need pixel-perfect. They need "professional and launched."</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The framework:</strong> Use AI builders for MVPs, test projects, validation, launches. Use traditional builders when you need exact control over every pixel or have complex layout requirements that AI can't handle.</p>
