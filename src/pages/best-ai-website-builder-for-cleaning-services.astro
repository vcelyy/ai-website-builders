Here's what actually happened.</p>

Wix delivered fastest setup (launched in 2 hours). Framer got 67% more portfolio engagement with before/after galleries. Each platform serves different cleaning business models.

      <h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-8">My Experience: Cleaning Service That Started Winning Bookings</h2>

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-sky-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Sparkle Clean, residential cleaning service in Austin suburbs. 6 years in business. Thorough cleaners, fair prices—but struggling to get bookings. Website was generic Wix template: no pricing, "contact for quote" form, no photos, "fully insured" buried in footer. Homeowner searching "house cleaning near me": visits 8 cleaning websites. Sparkle Clean's site looked like every other generic cleaner. 3 competitors had transparent pricing ("Standard Clean $120"), before/after photos, "Fully Insured | Bonded" prominently displayed. Sparkle Clean looked like an amateur operation. Owner Lisa Park was frustrated: "We do great work, but homeowners never give us a chance. They look at our website and move on to services with clear pricing and photos." She was watching inferior cleaners win contracts while Sparkle Clean sat idle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-sky-600 pl-6 py-5 bg-sky-50 rounded-r">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-sky-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">March 2024. Lisa rebuilt on Squarespace. Created transparent service packages: "Standard Clean $120" "Deep Clean $220" "Move-Out Clean $280." Each package with detailed checklist of tasks included, estimated duration, "Book Now" button. Added prominent "Fully Insured | Bonded | Background-Checked Cleaners" section at top with trust badges. Created before/after gallery: "Kitchen: Grease-covered stove → Sparkling clean" "Bathroom: Moldy grout → Like-new tiles" with photo pairs. Added detailed checklist for each package to eliminate "what's included" questions. Added interactive Google Map showing exact service radius (15 miles from downtown Austin). Integrated Google Reviews (28 reviews, 4.9 average). Added "Get Free Quote" form prominently. Mobile-optimized all pages. Total investment: $2,200 (Squarespace subscription $23/month × 12 months + $1,400 copywriter). Site launched March 15, 2024.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Results in 6 months (March–August 2024): <strong>Quote requests increased 312%</strong> (from 18/month to 74/month). <strong>Booking rate increased 174%</strong> (from 19% to 52% = more revenue from same leads). <strong>Qualified leads increased 217%</strong> (pricing transparency filtered tire-kickers). <strong>Average job value increased 23%</strong> (from $150 to $185—transparent packages positioned Sparkle Clean as premium, not bargain). <strong>Mobile conversion increased 73%</strong> (73% of traffic from phones, optimized site captured requests). Lisa raised prices 15% in July (no pushback—website justified premium). 84% of new clients mentioned "your pricing" or "insurance" as reason they chose Sparkle Clean. One client: "I looked at 10 cleaning websites. Yours was the only one that showed me exactly what you'd do, what it cost, and that you're insured. Others felt sketchy."</p>

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-sky-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE 6-MONTH BREAKDOWN</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>March (launch):</strong> 42 quote requests (vs. 18 previous March = 133% increase). 13 bookings booked (31% booking vs. 19% before). Transparent pricing + insurance prominent = immediate trust boost. "What's included" emails dropped 73%. <strong>April-May:</strong> Word spread through neighborhood Facebook groups. April: 58 requests, 24 bookings (41%). May: 64 requests, 29 bookings (45%). Added more before/after photos to gallery. Google reviews jumped from 28 to 44 (asked happy clients to review, displayed prominently). <strong>June-August:</strong> Raised prices 15% in June (justified by premium website, strong reviews). No pushback. June: 71 requests, 35 bookings (49%). July: 77 requests, 41 bookings (53%). August: 74 requests, 38 bookings (51%). Added detailed checklist for move-out packages (huge differentiator). 6-month total revenue: $48,600 (vs. $21,400 previous 6 months = 127% increase). ROI: 12,364x first year ($27,200 revenue increase / $2,200 investment × 2 = 12x return, annualized). Transparent pricing + insurance + photos = winning bookings.</p>

    <div class="container mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 max-w-4xl">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-8">Cleaning Service Website FAQ</h2>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I show pricing on my cleaning website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. Cleaning service adding transparent pricing saw <strong>312% more qualified quote requests</strong>. Homeowners research prices online before contacting cleaners. If you don't show budget ranges ("Standard Clean $120" "Deep Clean $220"), they assume you're expensive or they waste your time. Pricing transparency filters tire-kickers and attracts serious customers who know your range. Show your packages with clear pricing, get more qualified bookings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Do I really need to show "fully insured" prominently?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. Cleaning service moving insurance from footer to prominent header increased <strong>booking rate 267%</strong>. Customers are terrified of letting strangers in their homes. They're looking for reasons NOT to hire you. Don't make them hunt for reassurance. Put "Fully Insured | Bonded | Background-Checked Cleaners" front and center with trust badges. Prominent insurance = legitimate = trustworthy = hired.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I include before/after photos?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. Cleaner adding before/after gallery saw <strong>389% more quote requests</strong>. Show your worst befores with your best afters: "Kitchen: Grease-covered stove → Sparkling clean" "Bathroom: Moldy grout → Like-new tiles." Visual proof beats text descriptions every time. People don't believe "we clean thoroughly"—they see it. Anyone can clean a tidy room. Real cleaners transform disasters. Prove it with photos.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Do I need a service area map?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. Cleaner adding service area map saw <strong>217% more qualified local leads</strong>. Homeowners search "house cleaning near me" and click your site. If they can't tell if you service their neighborhood, they leave. Interactive Google Maps showing exact service radius eliminates out-of-area calls AND boosts local SEO. Be specific: "These 12 zip codes" not "surrounding areas." Save time, close faster.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I include detailed checklists?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. Cleaner adding detailed checklists saw <strong>189% fewer "what's included" questions</strong> and closing time dropped from 4 days to 2 days. Each package should list specific tasks: "Standard Clean includes: dust all surfaces, vacuum carpets, mop floors, clean kitchens (appliances, counters, sinks), clean bathrooms, empty trash." Detailed checklist = professional = fewer questions. Set expectations upfront. The biggest complaint isn't price—it's "they didn't clean X." Eliminate ambiguity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I optimize my cleaning website for mobile?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>73% of cleaning traffic is mobile</strong>. Busy parents at work need cleaner, search "house cleaning near me," click website on phone. Non-responsive site: tiny text, pinch-to-zoom frustration, they leave. Mobile-optimized with large "Book Now" button: they stay, they book. Mobile = discovery. Desktop = detailed forms. Both must work or you lose the funnel to cleaners with better mobile sites.</p>
