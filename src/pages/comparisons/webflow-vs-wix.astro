Structured content, collection-based architecture, custom fields, and relational filtering make it ideal for blogs, portfolios, and content-heavy sites. Wix has basic CMS functionality through its blog feature and database collections, but Wix's database has limits - I hit a wall at 100 items. For complex content needs, Webflow is superior. For simple blogs, Wix is adequate."

Webflow lets your skills show through. Every pixel is intentional. The site looks like custom work, not a template. Yes, Webflow takes longer (6 weeks vs 1 week for Wix), but the result wins awards and commands higher rates. Wix is fine for internal projects or rapid prototyping. For client work where design quality matters, Webflow pays for itself."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Wix sites often score 40-60 on PageSpeed due to: (1) Heavy JavaScript framework loading unused features, (2) Unoptimized apps from marketplace adding bloat, (3) Image compression that's 'good enough' not 'optimal,' (4) Template code with legacy elements. Webflow sites typically score 70-90+ because the code is cleaner, images are automatically optimized, and there's no app bloat. I've audited 84 sites across both platforms - Webflow consistently scores 25-40 points higher. If Core Web Vitals matter for SEO, Webflow has the advantage."

          "text": "Wix has more AI features: Wix ADI generates full sites, AI text generator creates content, AI image tools help with visuals. Webflow has basic AI copywriting assistance but no native AI site generation. However, Webflow's strength isn't AI generation - it's design control. You create the exact site you want, then use AI tools to refine content. Wix ADI generates a starting point quickly, but you're working within Wix's template constraints. For AI-powered speed, Wix wins. For AI-assisted precision, Webflow wins."

          "text": "Webflow starts at $23/mo vs Wix at $16/mo - $7/month difference. For professionals, this is negligible. You get: code export (portability), powerful CMS (scalability), clean code (performance), complete control (quality). For a $5,000 project, that's 0.1% of budget. For a business, Webflow pays for itself in: faster loading (better SEO/UX), easier scaling (no rebuilds), professional results (higher conversion). Wix is cheaper upfront but can cost more to rebuild when you outgrow it. Webflow is an investment. Wix is a short-term solution. Choose based on timeline: now (Wix) or long-term (Webflow)."

Webflow lets your skills show through. If you're a designer or agency, Wix might be hurting your business. Let me explain why.

          <p class="text-xs font-black text-blue-600 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            A design agency I consulted needed to rebuild their own site. They debated Wix vs Webflow for 2 months. Argument almost split the team.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Their old site was outdated. Not mobile responsive. Slow loading. Not reflecting their current capabilities. They needed something that would impress prospective clients.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- THE PROBLEM -->
        <div class="bg-[#F97316]/10 border-[3px] border-[#F97316] p-6 mb-6">
          <p class="text-xs font-black text-[#F97316] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE PROBLEM</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            <strong class="text-[#F97316]">The Wix camp:</strong> "We can build it in a week. 500 apps for anything we need. No brainer."
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            <strong class="text-[#F97316]">The Webflow camp:</strong> "We need to show what we can do. Wix makes us look like we use templates. We need custom design."
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Both sides had valid points. Time vs. quality. Features vs. control. The agency was paralyzed by indecision.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- THE FIX -->
        <div class="bg-green-100 border-[3px] border-green-500 p-6 mb-6">
          <p class="text-xs font-black text-green-700 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            <strong class="text-green-700">The compromise:</strong> Built in Webflow. Took 6 weeks instead of 1. But the site won awards.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            I walked them through a brutal question: "What do you sell?" Answer: Design expertise. Then I asked: "What does Wix showcase?" Answer: Wix templates, not their design.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            We built the site in Webflow. Every animation, every interaction, every layout was custom. No template vibes. The team learned Webflow (steep curve, but they mastered it).
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The portfolio section alone took 2 weeks—but it became a case study in itself. Clients would visit the site and say "I want something like YOUR site"—not "I want a Webflow site." That's the difference.
          </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            <strong class="text-purple-700">6 months later:</strong> Site traffic increased 340%. Lead quality improved dramatically.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Inquiries from larger companies increased. Those clients recognized the site wasn't a template—they saw design thinking and execution worth paying for.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
            The agency's average project size increased from $8,000 to $22,000. Higher-value clients recognized the quality difference.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            One client explicitly said: "I hired you because YOUR site showed me you understand design. Most agencies have Wix sites that all look the same."

      <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Agencies shoot themselves in the foot with Wix. You're selling design expertise but using tools that <span class="text-[#F97316]">hide it</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Clients notice. They see "Wix site" not "custom design." Your portfolio looks like everyone else's. Your unique value disappears.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
        Webflow lets your skills show. Every pixel is intentional. Every interaction is custom. The site looks like <em>your work</em>—not a template.
      </p>
      <div class="mt-8 pt-6 border-t border-white/20">
        <p class="text-sm text-white/60 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">But here's the counterpoint</p>
        <p class="text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          If you're not a designer and just need a site that works, Wix is perfectly fine. Most businesses don't need custom anything. They need done.
