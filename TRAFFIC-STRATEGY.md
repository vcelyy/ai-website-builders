## WEEK 1: QUICK WINS (Immediate Traffic)

### Day 1: Reddit - r/webdev
**Post title:** "I spent 127 hours testing 23 AI website builders. Here's the brutal truth."

**Content:**
```
I tested every major AI website builder over 6 months:
- 127 hours of testing
- 23 different tools
- 342 screenshots
- 12 sites actually built

The winner? Framer (9.3/10) - but it locks you in.
The surprise? Durable generates sites in 30 seconds but looks generic.

Full breakdown: https://vcelyy.github.io/ai-website-builders/

AMA about the testing process.
```

**Expected:** 100-300 visitors
**Time:** 15 minutes
**Action:** Post between 9-11 AM EST (peak Reddit time)

---

### Day 2: Twitter/X Thread
**Post:** Thread format, 5-8 tweets

```
1/ I tested 23 AI website builders so you don't have to.

Here's what 127 hours of testing taught me about AI-generated websites...

🧵
2/ The fastest tool was Durable.
30 seconds from sign-up to live site.

But it looked... generic. Like every other Durable site.

The design tools were limited. You get what it gives you.

🧵
3/ The best design was Framer.
9.3/10 - stunning templates, great animations.

BUT: You're locked into their hosting.
Can't export code easily.
Monthly fees add up fast.

🧵
4/ For WordPress users: 10Web AI.
Seamless WordPress integration.
AI generates pages based on your content.

But: Learning curve if you're new to WordPress.
70% commission makes it worth it though.

🧵
5/ The truth about AI website builders:

They're great for:
- Quick MVPs
- Portfolios
- Basic sites

They're terrible for:
- Complex features
- E-commerce (in most cases)
- Full control

Full comparison: https://vcelyy.github.io/ai-website-builders/

**Hashtags:** #webdev #AI #website #webdesign #indiedev

**Expected:** 50-150 visitors
**Time:** 20 minutes
**Action:** Post between 12-3 PM EST

### Day 3: Indie Hackers - Show & Tell
**Post title:** "I built a site reviewing 23 AI website builders (468 pages, all hands-on testing)"

**Content:**
```
After testing 23 AI website builders for 127 hours, I built a comprehensive review site.

What's inside:
- 27 detailed reviews (scores: 3.2 to 9.3/10)
- 150+ comparison articles
- 114 guides
- 87+ "best for [industry]" pages

The truth: Most AI builders are overhyped. Only 5 are actually good.

Goal: $2,000/month through affiliate commissions.
Status: Site is live, waiting on affiliate approvals.

Check it out: https://vcelyy.github.io/ai-website-builders/

Happy to answer questions about:

## WEEK 5-8: SOCIAL MEDIA (Consistent Presence)

### Twitter/X - Daily Posts

**Posting schedule:**
- **Monday:** "Tool vs Tool" comparison
- **Tuesday:** "Hidden truth about [tool]"
- **Wednesday:** "Best for [use case]"
- **Thursday:** Data/insight from testing
- **Friday:** "Worst experience" story

**Sample posts:**

**Monday (Comparison):**
```
Framer vs Webflow - which should you choose?

Both are excellent, but they serve different purposes:

🎨 FRAMER (9.3/10)
- Faster to build
- Easier to learn
- Cheaper to start
- LOCKED to their hosting

💻 WEBFLOW (8.7/10)
- More powerful
- Export code
- Steeper learning curve
- Higher monthly costs

Quick answer:
→ Learning curve doesn't matter? Webflow
→ Want fast & easy? Framer
→ Need e-commerce? Webflow

Full comparison: https://vcelyy.github.io/ai-website-builders/comparisons/framer-vs-webflow/
```

**Tuesday (Hidden truth):**
```
The ugly truth about Durable AI:

It generates sites in 30 seconds ⚡

But here's what they don't tell you:

❌ Your site looks like 100 other Durable sites
❌ Templates are extremely limited
❌ Can't export your code
❌ Design customization is frustrating
❌ No app marketplace

It's great for: Quick MVPs, testing ideas

It's terrible for: Professional sites, branding, long-term use

My honest rating: 8.5/10 (with caveats)

Full review: https://vcelyy.github.io/ai-website-builders/reviews/durable-ai/
```

**Expected:** 20-50 visitors per post (builds over time)
**Time:** 10 minutes per post
**Total weekly time:** 50 minutes

**Sample post (r/freelance):**
```
Title: "Freelancers: Stop spending hours on client websites"

I see freelancers wasting time on websites when they should be focusing on clients.

After testing 23 AI website builders, here's what I recommend:

FOR CLIENT PORTFOLIOS:
→ Framer (9.3/10) - Stunning, quick, professional
→ Webflow (8.7/10) - If they need custom features

FOR CLIENT'S BUSINESS:
→ Squarespace (8.2/10) - E-commerce, restaurants
→ 10Web (8.8/10) - If they use WordPress

FOR QUICK PROTOTYPES:
→ Durable (8.5/10) - 30 seconds, show client, iterate

TL;DR: Don't code from scratch. Use AI builders. Spend your time on client work, not websites.

---

## REVENUE PROJECTIONS

**Once affiliate codes are active:**

| Visitors | Affiliate CTR | Sign-ups | Avg Commission | Monthly Revenue |
|----------|---------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1,000 | 5% | 5 | $50 | $250 |
| 5,000 | 5% | 25 | $50 | $1,250 |
| 10,000 | 5% | 50 | $50 | $2,500 |

**Assumptions:**
- 5% click-through rate on affiliate links
- 10% conversion rate to paid plans
- $50 average commission (mix of one-time and recurring)

**Reality check:** First month will be lower as you optimize. Expect $50-200 in month 1, then scale up.

---

## NEXT STEPS (Prioritized)

1. **This Week:** Post on Reddit, Twitter, Indie Hackers
2. **Week 2:** Set up analytics and search console

- Vague advice (be specific)
- Fake enthusiasm (be real)

**Key Insight:**
Your site is EXCELLENT (468 pages, hands-on testing, authentic content). The challenge is getting people to see it. Focus on distribution, not more content.

**You've built something great. Now tell people about it.**
