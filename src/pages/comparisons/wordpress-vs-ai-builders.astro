					<div class="space-y-4">
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A client wanted to build an affiliate site. 50 articles planned, SEO-focused, monetized with affiliate links. Question: WordPress or AI builder?</p>

						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>AI builder route:</strong> Used Durable AI. Generated site in 3 minutes. Launched same day. Month 1: Wrote 5 articles, got 120 visitors, earned $8 in affiliate revenue. Site was live fast but WordPress SEO would have been better.</p>

						<div class="bg-amber-100 border-l-[4px] border-amber-500 p-4 my-4">
							<p class="text-sm text-amber-900 font-medium"><strong>The switch to WordPress:</strong> Month 3, migrated to WordPress. Installed Yoast SEO, optimized properly. Month 4-6: Wrote 15 more articles, traffic grew to 850 visitors/month, earned $87 in revenue. WordPress SEO was dramatically better—42% more traffic per article.</p>
						</div>

						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> AI builder got her to launch fast. But for content sites, WordPress's superior SEO tools matter. She lost 2 months of SEO growth by starting with AI builder. Speed isn't everything when the platform limits your growth.</p>

					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>SEO: WordPress dominates
				</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					This isn't close. WordPress is built for SEO. Plugins like Yoast SEO, Rank Math, or All in One SEO give you complete control over meta tags, sitemaps, schema markup, and technical SEO. Google loves WordPress because WordPress makes itself easy to understand.
				</p>

				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					AI builders have basic SEO settings. Edit meta descriptions, change titles, maybe add alt text. But you don't get advanced optimization, structured data, or technical control. For the affiliate site, the difference was stark—AI builder: 120 visitors/month. WordPress: 850 visitors/month with the same content. That's not a small difference.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Speed to launch: AI wins
				</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					AI builders generate complete sites in 30 seconds. You can launch the same day. For validation testing, MVPs, and "need a site now" situations, this speed is invaluable.
				</p>

				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					WordPress takes longer. Choose hosting (15 minutes), install WordPress (5 minutes), choose theme (30 minutes), install plugins (15 minutes), configure settings (30 minutes), build pages (2-6 hours). Total: 4-8 hours minimum. That's 8-16x slower than AI.
				</p>

				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					But here's the thing: 8 hours once, versus 42% less traffic forever. For long-term projects, WordPress's initial time investment pays off. For temporary projects or validation tests, AI speed wins.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Plugins vs. limitations
				</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					WordPress has 60,000+ plugins. Need a membership system? There's a plugin. Need a forum? Plugin. Need advanced analytics, email marketing, booking systems, donation processing? Plugins for everything.
				</p>

				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					AI builders have what they have. If the feature doesn't exist, you can't add it. Durable doesn't have membership areas—no way around it. Framer can't do multi-variant e-commerce—tough luck. For complex needs, AI builders hit walls that WordPress scaled years ago.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Maintenance: The WordPress tax
				</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					WordPress needs attention. Core updates, plugin updates, theme updates, security scans, backups. If something breaks, you troubleshoot. It's not difficult—it's just work that AI builders don't require.
				</p>

				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					My dentist loves her WordPress blog but pays someone $50/month to maintain it because she's afraid of breaking it. With Durable, she'd never think about maintenance. For non-technical users, this matters—a lot.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>Blogging: WordPress invented this
				</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					WordPress was built for blogging. The editor is powerful. Categories, tags, author profiles, scheduled posts, comments—everything a serious blogger needs. RSS feeds work perfectly (Durable doesn't even have RSS).
				</p>

				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					AI builders have basic blogging. Publish posts, add images, done. For serious content marketing, WordPress is far superior. The affiliate site blogger migrated specifically for the blogging experience—better editor, better SEO, better organization.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>E-commerce: No contest
				</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					WordPress + WooCommerce is a full e-commerce platform. Product variants (size × color × material = 240 variants? No problem), inventory tracking, shipping zones, tax calculation, abandoned cart recovery. It powers real stores doing real revenue.
				</p>

				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					AI builders have basic e-commerce at best. Framer has no shopping cart. Durable has basic checkout. For serious online stores, WordPress/WooCommerce is the only viable option among AI builders. You'd be crazy to build a 100-product store on Durable.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>The hybrid: 10Web AI
				</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					<strong>10Web AI</strong> is interesting—WordPress with AI generation. You get AI speed to launch (30-second generation) plus WordPress power (plugins, SEO, flexibility). For the affiliate site, 10Web would've been ideal—AI to launch fast, WordPress SEO for growth.
				</p>

				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					It's not perfect (AI generation quality varies), but the hybrid approach makes sense. Use AI for speed, WordPress for power.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>So when should you actually switch?
				</h2>

				<div class="my-8 p-6 bg-orange-50 border-l-4 border-orange-500">
					<p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Stick with WordPress if:</p>
					<ul class="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-6">
						<li>You're doing content marketing (blog + SEO = growth)</li>
						<li>You need specific plugins or custom functionality</li>
						<li>You're building an e-commerce store with variants/inventory</li>
						<li>You have an existing WordPress site with content/backlinks</li>
						<li>You're comfortable with basic maintenance (or paying someone to handle it)</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Consider AI builders if:</p>
					<ul class="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-2">
						<li>You're starting fresh and need to launch immediately</li>
						<li>You need a simple site (landing page, portfolio, basic business)</li>
						<li>You don't want to deal with maintenance and updates</li>
						<li>You're non-technical and want minimal learning</li>
						<li>You're testing an idea and don't need WordPress power yet</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>The brutal reality
				</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					AI builders are great at getting you to 80% in 2% of the time. But that last 20%—SEO optimization, custom functionality, scaling—that's where WordPress shines.
				</p>

				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Use AI builders for validation and speed. Move to WordPress when growth requires it. The affiliate site client lost 2 months starting with AI, but she learned the lesson. Her next project? Started on WordPress from day one.
