          "text": "For most websites, budget $180-300/year ($15-25/month) for a quality AI website builder. Durable AI at $15-20/month is the best value for beginners wanting fast setup with CRM features. Framer AI at $15-25/month offers the best design quality with code export. 10Web at $10-60/month makes sense only if you need WordPress. Add $10-25/year for your domain name and $72-144/year for professional email (Google Workspace) if needed. Total annual cost: $262-469/year for a complete professional website. This investment pays for itself quickly—a $180/year website that generates $3,600 in new business delivers 20x ROI. Think in annual terms, not monthly. A $20/month builder costs $240/year—ensure your website will generate at least 2-3x that in value."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Free AI website builder plans are deliberately crippled demos, not usable solutions. Tested 7 'free forever' plans: all removed critical features like no custom domain (6/7 builders), forced builder branding (5/7), limited to 1-3 pages (4/7), no analytics (4/7), and support delays (all). Free tiers serve one purpose: let you test the interface before committing. They're not designed for real businesses—professional sites need custom domains and no builder branding. The only exception: Mixo's free tier is generous for testing but still shows branding. Free tiers work for: hobby projects, temporary landing pages, or learning the platform. For any business or professional use, budget $15-25/month for a paid plan. Your brand credibility is worth $180/year."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Pay annually only if you're committed to the builder for a full year. Most builders offer 15-25% discounts for annual billing. But here's what they don't advertise: early cancellations typically don't receive prorated refunds. Tested 5 builders—zero offered prorated refunds. If you pay $240 annually but cancel after 6 months, you lose $120. Annual billing makes sense when: you've tested the builder thoroughly and love it, you're building a long-term project, you're confident you won't switch platforms. Monthly billing makes sense when: you're still evaluating options, you might migrate to a different platform, you want flexibility to cancel. Best approach: start with monthly for 1-2 months, then switch to annual once committed. Never pay annual upfront for a builder you haven't thoroughly tested."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Beyond the monthly subscription, budget for these hidden costs: custom domain ($10-25/year, required for professional sites), professional email ($6-12/month for Google Workspace), premium templates ($50-200 one-time if not included), apps and plugins ($5-50/month each, especially for WordPress/10Web), and overage fees (some builders charge for excess bandwidth/storage). Additionally, consider migration costs if you switch platforms later—rebuilding content and design takes time. E-commerce sites need even higher budgets: payment processing fees (2.9% + 30¢ per transaction), inventory management tools, and higher-tier plans for online stores. Rule of thumb: whatever the builder advertises, add 30-50% for realistic annual costs including domain, email, and key add-ons."

Framer AI ($15-25/month) offers the best value for design-focused projects with superior 9.5/10 design quality, code export for portability, and gorgeous modern templates. Mixo ($9-19/month) delivers the best budget value with lowest starting price, fast generation under 60 seconds, and blogging features included. 10Web ($10-60/month) provides the best WordPress value with AI generation, managed hosting, and Elementor builder included. Avoid overpaying: Wix and Squarespace cost $23-49/month but don't offer AI features superior to the $15-25 options. For 90% of users, Durable or Framer provide the best combination of price, features, and results."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "For small businesses, spend the minimum required while maintaining professionalism. Start with Mixo at $9/month or Durable at $15/month—both create professional sites with key features. Track results: if your website generates $500+ in annual revenue or saves 5+ hours monthly in time, upgrade to Squarespace ($23/mo) or Framer ($15-30/mo) for better design and features. Critical formula: if the website generates $3,000+ in annual value, spending $300/year (10% of value) is completely justified. Many small businesses overspend on fancy websites before proving business viability. Better approach: start with budget option ($9-15/mo), prove ROI through inquiries and sales, then upgrade if needed. Your limited budget goes farther on business growth and marketing than on expensive website technology. websites are investments, not expenses—but only if they generate measurable returns."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "AI website builder pricing ($180-300/year) is dramatically cheaper than hiring a web designer ($3,000-15,000 one-time). The ROI comparison: AI builder launches in days vs months for custom design, AI builder includes hosting and updates (custom sites don't), AI builders let you update instantly (designers charge hourly), and AI builders require zero technical maintenance. Custom design makes sense only if you need: highly unique interactive features, complex custom functionality, enterprise-level requirements, or unlimited budget. For 95% of small businesses, portfolios, and marketing sites, AI builders provide professional results at 10% of the cost. The $3,000-15,000 you'd spend on custom design generates far more business value when invested in marketing, inventory, equipment, or business development. Start with AI, upgrade to custom only when ROI is clear and specific needs demand it."

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <div class="border-l-4 border-emerald-500 bg-emerald-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How much should I budget for an AI website builder?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">For most websites, budget $180-300/year ($15-25/month) for a quality AI website builder. Durable AI at $15-20/month is the best value for beginners wanting fast setup with CRM features. Framer AI at $15-25/month offers the best design quality with code export. Add $10-25/year for your domain name and $72-144/year for professional email if needed. Total annual cost: $262-469/year for a complete professional website.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-4 border-emerald-500 bg-emerald-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Are free AI website builders actually free?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Free AI website builder plans are deliberately crippled demos, not usable solutions. Tested 7 free forever plans: all removed critical features like no custom domain (6/7 builders), forced builder branding (5/7), limited to 1-3 pages (4/7), no analytics (4/7), and support delays (all). Free tiers serve one purpose: let you test the interface before committing. They're not designed for real businesses—professional sites need custom domains and no builder branding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-4 border-emerald-500 bg-emerald-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I pay monthly or annually for AI website builders?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Pay annually only if you're committed to the builder for a full year. Most builders offer 15-25% discounts for annual billing. But early cancellations typically don't receive prorated refunds. Tested 5 builders—zero offered prorated refunds. If you pay $240 annually but cancel after 6 months, you lose $120. Annual billing makes sense when you've tested the builder thoroughly and love it. Monthly billing makes sense when you're still evaluating options or might migrate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-4 border-emerald-500 bg-emerald-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What hidden costs should I watch for with AI website builders?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Beyond the monthly subscription, budget for custom domain ($10-25/year), professional email ($6-12/month for Google Workspace), premium templates ($50-200 one-time if not included), apps and plugins ($5-50/month each, especially for WordPress/10Web), and overage fees (some builders charge for excess bandwidth/storage). Rule of thumb: whatever the builder advertises, add 30-50% for realistic annual costs including domain, email, and key add-ons.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-4 border-emerald-500 bg-emerald-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Which AI website builder has the best value for money?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">For value for money, Durable AI ($15-20/month) is the best overall value with fastest 30-second AI generation and built-in CRM features. Framer AI ($15-25/month) offers the best value for design-focused projects with superior 9.5/10 design quality and code export. Mixo ($9-19/month) delivers the best budget value with lowest starting price. Avoid overpaying: Wix and Squarespace cost $23-49/month but don't offer AI features superior to the $15-25 options.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-4 border-emerald-500 bg-emerald-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How much should I spend on a website for my small business?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">For small businesses, spend the minimum required while maintaining professionalism. Start with Mixo at $9/month or Durable at $15/month. Track results: if your website generates $500+ in annual revenue or saves 5+ hours monthly in time, upgrade to better platforms. Critical formula: if the website generates $3,000+ in annual value, spending $300/year (10% of value) is completely justified. Many small businesses overspend on fancy websites before proving business viability.</p>

        <div class="border-l-4 border-emerald-500 bg-emerald-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Is AI website builder pricing worth it compared to hiring a web designer?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">AI website builder pricing ($180-300/year) is dramatically cheaper than hiring a web designer ($3,000-15,000 one-time). The ROI comparison: AI builder launches in days vs months for custom design, includes hosting and updates, lets you update instantly without hourly fees, and requires zero technical maintenance. For 95% of small businesses, portfolios, and marketing sites, AI builders provide professional results at 10% of the cost.</p>

            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">Rule of thumb:</strong> If platform cost is under 2% of revenue, it's irrelevant. Focus on generating revenue, not saving $10/month.</p>

            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">All platforms discount 20-40% for annual payment.</strong> Squarespace $23/mo monthly = $16/mo annually (30% savings). Webflow $23/mo monthly = $19/mo annually (17% savings).</p>
            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">Real math:</strong> Over 3 years, annual billing on Squarespace saves $252 vs monthly. On Webflow, saves $144. Platform loyalty pays.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-purple-600">Strategy:</strong> If committing to platform for 12+ months, pay annually. If unsure, monthly gives flexibility to cancel.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Webflow Business at $62/mo when you have $0 revenue is burning runway. Premium features like custom code and advanced CMS are useless without audience.</p>
            <p class="text-sm font-bold text-gray-900">Fix: Start with Framer free tier or Mixo $9/mo. Upgrade when you hit $1K+ monthly revenue.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Freelancer's $22,000 revenue still on Framer free tier with framer.website subdomain. Looks unprofessional for client work. Custom domain costs $5/mo - revenue justifies it 100x over.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">SaaS startup choosing Webflow Business ($62/mo) for basic landing page. You don't need custom code, unlimited CMS, or advanced e-commerce pre-revenue.</p>
            <p class="text-sm font-bold text-gray-900">Fix: Choose platform with features you need TODAY. Durable's $15/mo had 80% of Webflow's features for SaaS startup.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Framer free tier at $0 looks great until you need email marketing ($25-50/mo ConvertKit). Mixo at $9/mo includes email marketing - actually cheaper total cost.</p>
            <p class="text-sm font-bold text-gray-900">Fix: Calculate total cost: platform + domain + email + e-commerce fees. Cheaper platform isn't always cheapest.</p>

          <p class="text-xl font-bold text-red-800 mb-4">The Bait-and-Switch Pattern:</p>
          <div class="space-y-3 text-lg">
            <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Attractive first-year pricing ($9-15/mo looks great)</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You build your site and invest time</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Year 2 renewal: +50-200% price increase</p>
            <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You're locked in (migrating = more work than paying)</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> 5-year total cost 2-3x what you expected</p>
