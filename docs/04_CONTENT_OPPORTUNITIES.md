## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The AI website builder niche has significant content gaps. Most competitors:
1. Cover AI builders as a subsection of general website builders
2. Have outdated or superficial AI content
3. Lack hands-on testing with visual proof
4. Miss emerging AI-specific tools (Framer AI, Durable, Relume, etc.)

**Key Opportunity:** A dedicated AI-only review site with modern, hands-on content.
