          <p class="text-sm font-black text-gray-600 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE: 18 CALLS/MONTH, $15,000 REVENUE, INVISIBLE EMERGENCY CONTRACTOR</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Mike Rodriguez runs Rodriguez Electric in Seattle. 15 years experience, master electrician, excellent reputation. Website: outdated 2018 template, "Electrical Services" vague, emergency contact buried on contact page, mobile site difficult to navigate. Result: 18 calls/month, $15,000 revenue, mostly repeat customers. Problem: power outages happen = homeowners search emergency electrician = never find Rodriguez. Competitors with modern sites get the calls. Rodriguez: "I'm the best electrician in Seattle, but nobody knows when they need emergency help. My website looks like I went out of business in 2019."</p>

Total investment: $2,900 (Wix subscription for 1 year). Build time: 4 days. Rodriguez: "I focused on emergency visibility. When power's out, people don't research - they call whoever shows available first."</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Month 1 results: 42 emergency calls (up from 18, 133% increase), $28,000 revenue. Google ranking: page 1 position 2 for "emergency electrician Seattle." Emergency visible: homeowners call Rodriguez first when power's out. Licensed insured visible: trust = safe contractor = hire. Services clear: customers call for specific projects Rodriguez actually does. Mobile call button: 89% of emergency searches on phones = click call = instant business. Service areas: customers know Rodriguez serves their area = call instead of scrolling. Rodriguez: "Professional website = legitimate electrician = trust = calls. Before: invisible despite excellent work. After: emergency visible = they call me first = business. Best $2,900 I ever spent." Month 3: 62 calls/month, $52,000 revenue. Investment: $2,900.

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake #1: Burying emergency service</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Electrician adds "we offer emergency service" on contact page. Result: nobody sees it. Power outage = search = visit your site = don't see emergency = call competitor. Fix: Add "24/7 Emergency Electrical" to hero with phone prominent. Emergency visible first impression = they call you.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Site lists "electrical services" without specifics. Customer searching "panel upgrade electrician" - does Rodriguez do that? Unclear = they call competitor. Fix: List services explicitly: "Rewiring, Panel Upgrades, EV Charger Installation, Generator Install." Specific services = they call you for their project.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-red-500 pl-6 py-5 bg-red-50/50 rounded-r">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mistake #3: Hidden licensing credentials</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Electrician mentions "licensed & insured" in footer text. Result: customers miss it, doubt legitimacy, call competitor who displays credentials prominently. Fix: Add "License #ELEC-98765 | Fully Licensed & Insured" near hero. Credentials visible = legitimate = safe = hire you.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Site requires 3 clicks to find phone number. Power outage = customer on phone = can't easily call = click back = call competitor. Fix: Add one-click "Call Now" button sticky in header always visible. Easy call = emergency business.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Contractor serves 5 counties but doesn't list them. Customer searching "electrician near Tacoma" - not sure if Rodriguez serves there = calls competitor who lists service areas. Fix: Add "Serving: Seattle, Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland" prominently. Service areas visible = you serve my area = I call you.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700">Website looks like 2015 template. Customer: "if this site's outdated, maybe they're not in business anymore or don't care."

      Electricians waste 20+ hours on wrong platforms—missing safety credentials, no emergency capture, weak service display. Right platform builds trust immediately, showcases services clearly, captures emergency calls efficiently. Best electrician platforms: Squarespace (professional templates), WordPress + plugins (booking systems), specialized trade platforms (Thumbtack, Angi), Webflow (custom layouts). Choose based on: service focus (residential vs commercial), emergency volume, marketing strategy. Most successful electrician websites: services prominent, license/certs visible, emergency service prominent, testimonials with safety outcomes, pricing transparent, contact easy.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Credibility, clean design</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Squarespace: professional templates with service layouts, credential displays, contact forms. For electricians prioritizing straightforward credibility presentation—Squarespace delivers professional results fast. Services, licenses, testimonials, emergency contact—launched in weekend. Less functionality than WordPress, sufficient for most electricians.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Residential electrician used Squarespace: services (rewiring, panel upgrades, EV charging), license # prominent, emergency 24/7 button, pricing ranges. Service calls increased 90% (professional presentation), justified premium pricing over competitors, captured $180k in new projects in first 6 months.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Scheduling, service requests</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">WordPress + plugins: booking plugins (Amelia, Bookly), service request forms, maintenance reminder systems. Plugin ecosystem adds electrical functionality fast. For electricians prioritizing online booking—WordPress superior scheduling. Trade-off: maintenance, security updates.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Electrical company used WordPress with booking plugin: online scheduling (service appointments), maintenance reminders (annual inspections), payment processing (deposits). Online bookings increased 140% (convenience), no-shows decreased 55% (reminders), revenue grew to $70k/month.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Trade platforms: Thumbtack, Angi (formerly Angie's List), TaskRabbit. Built-in audience seeking electrical services. For new electricians—these platforms provide immediate customer flow. Trade-off: 15-25% commission fees, less brand control. Most successful electricians use both: own website (recurring customers) + platforms (new customer acquisition).</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: New electrician started on Thumbtack: filled service calendar immediately, built 40+ reviews in 3 months. Added own website (Squarespace) after stabilizing: repeat business grew to 35% of revenue (maintenance contracts), platform usage decreased to 25% (new customers only).</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Webflow: pixel-perfect control, animated safety explanations, interactive project galleries. For electricians wanting premium presentations—animated electrical safety guides, before/after rewiring displays, smooth scroll project journeys. Steeper learning curve, but premium presentations justify higher pricing.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Premium electrical company used Webflow: animated safety guide (electrical hazards explained), before/after rewiring gallery, interactive panel upgrade comparison. High-end project leads increased 110% (visual demonstrations convinced upgrades), average project value increased from $3k to $8k (upsells worked).</p>

      Electrician websites succeed through: services prominent (rewiring, panel upgrades, EV charging, repairs), safety credentials visible (state license, NEC compliance, insurance), emergency service prominent (24/7 availability, rapid response), customer testimonials with safety outcomes (specific improvements, code compliance), pricing transparent (hourly rates, project ranges), service area clear (locations served), contact easy (phone prominent, online booking). Most electrician website mistakes: buried services (what do you do?), no safety credentials (why trust you?), no emergency button (urgent callers leave), hidden pricing (wastes time). Best practice: services above fold, license visible, emergency prominent, pricing transparent.
