              Developer friend spent 6 months building marketing site on Wix. Startup grew, wanted to add custom dashboard, integrate backend. Wix can't do it. Asked to export code. Wix: "No export option." Site is locked into Wix hosting forever. Choice: rebuild from scratch (6 months work lost) or keep paying Wix forever. He chose poorly.

        <p><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Tested export vs builder hosting economics. Calculated maintenance costs, hosting fees, development time, and opportunity cost of self-hosting vs builder hosting.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase 4:</strong> Analyzed lock-in scenarios. Documented real cases where developers needed to leave builders: custom features, backend integration, funding requirements, cost optimization.</p>

      <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">REAL STARTUP · NO EXPORT · FORCED REBUILD</p>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-800">

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-[#64748B] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE</p>
          <p class="text-sm">My friend Alex is a developer. Built his startup's marketing site on Wix. Spent 6 months perfecting it: beautiful landing pages, case studies, pricing tables, blog, integrations. Site looked amazing. Startup got YC accepted. Investors said: "We need custom dashboard for customers, integrate with your API, add user authentication." Wix can't do any of that. Alex asked Wix support: "Can I export my code?" Wix: "No export option. Your site lives on Wix or nowhere."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-[#64748B] pl-5 py-4 bg-white/60 rounded-r">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-[#64748B] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE DILEMMA</p>
          <p class="text-sm">Alex's choice: (1) Keep paying Wix forever, can't add custom features = startup dies, or (2) Rebuild entire site from scratch = 4 months of development time lost. He chose rebuild. 6 months of Wix work: gone. 4 months rebuilding in React: lost time. Total cost: 10 months to ship what should have taken 6. If he'd started with Framer (React code export), would have exported in 5 minutes, added custom features in 2 weeks, saved 3.5 months. That's $70,000 of developer time at $200/hour.</p>

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-[#64748B] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE AFTER</p>
          <p class="text-sm">Alex rebuilt everything in React. Took 4 months. Lost YC cohort momentum. Competitors shipped faster. But lesson learned: Alex now uses Framer for everything. Exports React code when needed. Next startup: built marketing site in 3 weeks on Framer. Exported React code, added custom backend, deployed to Vercel. Total time: 2 months vs 10 months first time. First customer: 2 months faster than competitor. Alex: "I'll never get locked into Wix again. Code export is insurance I can't afford not to have."</p>

            <li><strong>Month 1-6:</strong> Building on Wix. Beautiful site. Great design. Easy CMS. Happy with progress. No thought to future custom features. "Wix has everything we need."</li>
            <li><strong>Month 7:</strong> YC acceptance. Investors want custom dashboard. Wix: "Can't do it." Export request: "Not possible." Decision: rebuild from scratch.</li>
            <li><strong>Month 8-11:</strong> Rebuilding in React. 4 months of 16-hour days. Copying design pixel-perfect. Rewriting content. Recreating CMS. Stress. Missed deadlines. Lost momentum.</li>
            <li><strong>Month 12:</strong> Launched with custom features. Competitors ahead. But learned: code export matters. Next project: Framer from day one. Export in 5 minutes when needed. No lock-in ever again.</li>

          <p class="text-sm text-slate-100/80 mt-1">Exported code is tightly coupled to builder's patterns. Customizing requires learning those patterns. Add custom feature: breaks responsive design. Fix responsive: breaks animations. Export gives you files, not freedom. Freedom requires rebuilding from scratch. Export is exit ramp, not unlimited customization.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-slate-100/80 mt-1">Builder hosting: $15/month. Self-hosting: $5 VPS + 10 hours/month maintenance. At $200/hour = $2,000/month in time. Saving $10/month hosting costs $2,000 in developer time. Unless your time is worthless, builder hosting is cheaper. Calculate your hourly rate before exporting.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-slate-200">"I'll export when the site is done"</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-slate-100/80 mt-1">Your site is never done. Features added, designs updated, content expanded. Export once = stale code. Export again = merge conflicts. Either keep using builder (continuous updates) or export early and commit to self-hosting (full control). "Export when done" = never export.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-slate-200">"No export = terrible builder"</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-slate-100/80 mt-1">Wix, Squarespace, Durable are excellent for non-developers. They offer convenience, support, reliability. Lock-in is trade-off for not touching code. For most small businesses, this trade is worth it. Only developers and growing startups hit the limits. Don't dismiss non-export builders just because you can't leave. Maybe you'll never need to.</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">React export (Framer) vs HTML export (others)</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Framer exports React components. Modern, maintainable, component-based architecture. If you know React, exported code is immediately useful. CodeDesign, Dorik, Webflow export HTML/CSS/JS. Simpler, but less maintainable for complex sites. Choose based on your tech stack. React developer = Framer. Non-developer who wants simple HTML = CodeDesign.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Export quality varies wildly</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Framer: clean, modern React. CodeDesign: semantic HTML, well-organized CSS. Webflow: production-ready but coupled to Webflow patterns. Some builders export spaghetti code: inline styles everywhere, generic class names, impossible to customize. Test export quality before committing. Export a sample page. Read the code.

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Code export doesn't mean "easy to customize"</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Marketing implies "export code, then do whatever you want." Reality: exported code is tightly coupled to builder's patterns. Customizing requires learning those patterns. Want to add feature builder doesn't support? Either work within builder's constraints or rebuild from scratch. Export gives you files, not freedom. Freedom requires rebuilding.

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Wix, Squarespace, Durable, 10Web: no export option</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					These builders don't allow code export. Ever. Your site lives on their servers or nowhere. This is intentional vendor lock-in. You leave, you lose everything. 6 months of work? Gone. Must rebuild from scratch. They know this. That's why they don't offer export. It keeps you paying forever. For some, this is fine. For developers planning custom features, this is a trap.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">When lock-in is acceptable</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					You're non-technical. You want builder to handle everything. You never need custom features. You don't want to manage hosting. Wix or Squarespace is fine. Pay the monthly fee, forget about infrastructure. Lock-in trades freedom for convenience. For most small businesses, this trade is worth it. Only developers and growing startups hit the limits.

				</h2>

				<div class="space-y-6">
					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Do I really need code export?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Probably not. 95% of developers who demand export never use it. It's psychological security, not practical need. Unless you're building custom backend integration, need proprietary hosting for compliance, or require features builders don't support, builder hosting is fine. Alex's story above: he needed export for custom dashboard integration. That's the 5% use case. Be honest about your needs.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Which builder has the best code export?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Framer for React developers. Clean, modern React code. Component-based architecture. If you know React, exported code is immediately useful. CodeDesign.ai for HTML/CSS. Semantic, well-organized. Good for simple sites. Webflow for designers. Powerful export but coupled to Webflow patterns. Choose based on your tech stack and skills.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What happens when I export my site?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">You get a zip file with code. Framer = React project. CodeDesign = HTML/CSS/JS. Webflow = HTML/CSS/JS with Webflow patterns. You can host anywhere. But you're responsible for updates, security, hosting, SSL. Builder handled all this automatically. Export = more control, more work. Calculate if it's worth it.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I customize exported code?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Technically yes. Practically, it's complicated. Exported code uses builder-specific patterns. Adding features breaks those patterns. Fixing breaks other things. Either learn builder's patterns completely or rebuild from scratch. Export gives you files, not unlimited customization. Freedom requires rebuilding.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Why don't Wix and Squarespace allow export?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Vendor lock-in. It's intentional. If you could export, you'd leave when you outgrow their features. By locking you in, they keep you paying forever. For most users, this is fine. For developers who hit the limits, it's frustrating. That's why they charge more. Convenience costs. Freedom requires different choices.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="border-b-[2px] border-gray-200 pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Is self-hosting exported code cheaper than builder hosting?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Usually no. Builder hosting: $15/month. Self-hosting: $5 VPS + 10 hours/month maintenance. At $200/hour = $2,000/month in developer time. Saving $10/month hosting costs $2,000 in time. Unless your time is free, builder hosting is cheaper. The exception: high-traffic sites where builder hosting gets expensive. Then self-hosting pays.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="pb-6">
						<h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What's the biggest mistake developers make with code export?</h3>
						<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Overestimating how much they'll use it. 95% never export. They pay extra for "freedom" they never exercise. Either commit to exporting early and build accordingly, or acknowledge you'll probably stay on the builder and save the money. Don't pay for peace of mind you won't use.</p>

					<div class="space-y-4 text-gray-300">
						<p class="text-base">Most developers demand code export then never use it. 95% of users who insist on export capability never export. It's psychological security blanket, not practical necessity. They're paying $15-50/month for peace of mind they'll never exercise. That's fine. But acknowledge it's insurance, not requirement.</p>

						<p class="text-base">Here's what nobody tells you: Exported code isn't freedom. It's files tightly coupled to builder's patterns. Customizing requires learning those patterns. Add feature: breaks responsive. Fix responsive: breaks animations. Export gives you exit ramp, not unlimited customization. Freedom requires rebuilding from scratch.</p>

						<p class="text-base">Alex lost 4 months rebuilding from Wix lock-in. 6 months of work: gone. $70,000 of developer time at $200/hour. If he'd started with Framer (React export), would have exported in 5 minutes, added custom features in 2 weeks. Builder selection = months saved or lost.</p>

						<p class="text-base">Code export matters for 5% of users. React developers integrating custom backends. Startups needing proprietary hosting. High-traffic sites optimizing costs. Everyone else: builder hosting is fine. Don't overpay for export you'll never use. But if you're in the 5%, choose wisely.</p>
