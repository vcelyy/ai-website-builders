          "text": "Mixo (8.5/10) is better than Hostinger (7.8/10) overall, with superior ease of use (9.0/10 vs 8.5/10), better design quality (8.5/10 vs 7.5/10), and excellent value for money (9.0/10 vs 8.0/10). Hostinger's main advantage is lower starting pricing at $3/month compared to Mixo's $9/month, and includes free domain registration and email accounts. Mixo offers a much better user experience, better AI-powered website generation, cleaner designs, and a generous free tier for testing. Hostinger is better if you need the absolute lowest price and want domain/email included. Mixo is better for ease of use, design quality, and overall website building experience. For most users, Mixo's slightly higher cost is worth it for the significantly better experience and designs. Choose Hostinger for bare-bones budget needs. Choose Mixo for the best budget-friendly AI website building experience."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Hostinger is more affordable than Mixo at the entry level with lower starting pricing. Hostinger's AI website builder starts at just $3/month for basic plans, with premium tiers around $11/month for advanced features. Over 3 years, Hostinger costs as little as $108-396 depending on plan level. Importantly, Hostinger includes free domain registration (usually $10-15/year) and professional email accounts with business plans. Mixo offers a generous free tier for testing and paid plans start at $9/month. Over 3 years, Mixo costs approximately $324 for the base plan. While Hostinger's base pricing is significantly lower, Mixo includes better AI features and design quality at its price point. The total cost comparison depends on whether you factor in domain and email costs - Hostinger includes these, Mixo doesn't. For absolute lowest cost, Hostinger wins. For best experience under $10/month, Mixo provides better value."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Both Hostinger and Mixo include hosting with their website builders, but they approach it differently. Hostinger is primarily a web hosting company that added an AI website builder - hosting is their core business and they provide reliable infrastructure, free SSL certificates, and include domain registration and email accounts with their plans. Mixo is a dedicated AI website builder that includes hosting as part of their all-in-one service - your site is hosted on Mixo's infrastructure with SSL included, but you don't get separate email hosting or domain registration included. For hosting quality and reliability, Hostinger has the advantage as an established hosting provider. For simplicity and ease of use, Mixo's all-in-one approach is more straightforward. Both provide adequate hosting for most websites. Choose Hostinger if you want hosting from an established provider with email included. Choose Mixo if you want a simpler, more focused website building experience without managing separate hosting services."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Neither Hostinger nor Mixo is ideal for ecommerce, but they can handle basic product sales. Hostinger's website builder has basic ecommerce features - you can add products, a shopping cart, and payment processing via integrations like PayPal or Stripe. However, it's limited compared to dedicated ecommerce platforms. Mixo also offers basic ecommerce functionality - product listings, simple checkout, payment processing. But Mixo is primarily designed for landing pages and simple sites, not full-featured online stores. If you need serious ecommerce (inventory management, complex shipping, multiple payment gateways), look at dedicated platforms like Shopify or Webflow ecommerce. If you just need to sell a few products or services, both Hostinger and Mixo can handle basic ecommerce. For basic ecommerce, Mixo's better designs may convert better. Hostinger's advantage is lower cost if you're just testing."

        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Can I export my website from Hostinger or Mixo?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Neither Hostinger nor Mixo allows code export - both are proprietary platforms with vendor lock-in. Hostinger's website builder doesn't provide code export functionality. Your site is tied to Hostinger's platform and hosting. You can manually recreate your site elsewhere, but there's no automated export. Mixo also doesn't offer code export. Your website lives on Mixo's infrastructure and there's no way to download the source code or migrate to another platform automatically. This vendor lock-in is the trade-off for the convenience and low pricing of both platforms. If you need platform independence and the ability to export code, look at Webflow or Framer instead. If you're okay with vendor lock-in in exchange for ease of use and low pricing, both Hostinger and Mixo work well. Just be aware that switching platforms later means rebuilding your site from scratch."

        "name": "Do Hostinger or Mixo offer free trials?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Mixo has a better free offering than Hostinger. Mixo offers a genuinely generous free tier - you can build and publish a site with a mixo.io subdomain at no cost. This lets you fully test the platform, create a real site, and see if it works for you before paying. The free tier has some limitations but is functional for testing. Hostinger offers a trial period but not a true free tier - you typically get a money-back guarantee (30 days in most cases) but you need to enter payment details to start. Hostinger's approach is more like a traditional free trial rather than a free product tier. For risk-free testing without entering payment details, Mixo's free tier is superior. For testing with the option to refund if not satisfied, Hostinger's money-back guarantee works. If you want to fully test before committing, Mixo's free tier lets you do that without payment."

        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Which has better templates: Hostinger or Mixo?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Mixo has significantly better templates and design quality than Hostinger (8.5/10 vs 7.5/10). Mixo's AI-generated templates are modern, clean, with good typography and spacing - they look professional and trustworthy. The designs feel current and contemporary, not dated. Hostinger's templates are functional but average - they work, but they look generic and dated. Boxy layouts, dated styling, nothing that stands out. The template quality difference is one of the main reasons Mixo scores higher overall. If design matters to you - if you need your site to look professional and credible - Mixo is the clear winner. If you just need something functional and don't care about design aesthetics, Hostinger's templates are adequate. For businesses selling products or services, Mixo's better designs likely convert better. For personal projects or hobby sites, Hostinger's templates are sufficient."

        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A consultant needed a landing page fast. Budget: $10/month maximum. I tested both tools with his content.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Hostinger:</strong> $3/month, included email (he needed that). Built in 3 minutes. Template looked... acceptable. Generic, boxy, 2018 vibes. But it worked.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Mixo:</strong> $9/month. Built in 47 seconds. Template looked modern, professional, trustworthy. Clean typography, good spacing.</p>
          <div class="bg-indigo-100 border-l-[4px] border-indigo-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-indigo-900 font-medium"><strong>He chose Hostinger.</strong> Saved $6/month. Had email included. Seemed like the smart choice.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>6 months later:</strong> Hostinger site: 800 visitors, 12 inquiries (1.5% conversion). Generated $18,000 in revenue.</p>
          <div class="bg-violet-100 border-l-[4px] border-violet-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-violet-900 font-medium"><strong>The A/B test:</strong> He finally tested Mixo. Same traffic, same offer. 800 visitors, 19 inquiries (2.4% conversion). Generated $28,500 in revenue.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The Mixo site generated $10,500 more in 6 months. Hostinger saved him $36 over 6 months. That's a 29,000% ROI on the extra $6/month.</p>
          <div class="bg-purple-100 border-l-[4px] border-purple-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-purple-900 font-medium"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> He wasn't paying for a website. He was paying for credibility. The Mixo design looked like a $10,000 consultant. The Hostinger design looked like a side hustle. People buy from professionals, not side hustles.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Then the opposite:</strong> A hobby blogger. Zero revenue, just sharing recipes. Hostinger at $3/month with email was perfect. Who cares if the design looks 2018? She's not selling anything.</p>
          <div class="bg-fuchsia-100 border-l-[4px] border-fuchsia-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-fuchsia-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> If you're selling services or products, Mixo's design quality pays for itself 100x over. If you're not monetizing, Hostinger's $3/month is the right choice. But be honest about what "budget" actually costs you.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">I switched 4 more clients from Hostinger to Mixo after seeing this pattern. Average conversion increase: 0.8-1.2%. That's huge for businesses.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Is Hostinger or Mixo better for website building?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-teal-600">Mixo wins overall (8.5/10 vs 7.8/10).</strong> The key advantages: superior ease of use (9.0/10 vs 8.5/10), better design quality (8.5/10 vs 7.5/10), and excellent value for money (9.0/10 vs 8.0/10). Hostinger's only real advantage is lower starting pricing at $3/month compared to Mixo's $9/month, plus free domain and email accounts. Mixo offers better AI-powered website generation, cleaner modern designs, generous free tier for testing. If you need the absolute lowest price and want domain/email included, Hostinger works. For ease of use, design quality, and overall experience - Mixo justifies the extra $6/month. For most users, Mixo's significantly better experience is worth the cost difference.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">What is the price difference between Hostinger and Mixo?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-teal-600">Hostinger is cheaper, but Mixo is better value.</strong> Hostinger starts at $3/month for basic plans, $11/month for premium. Over 3 years: $108-396. Includes free domain registration ($10-15/year value) and professional email accounts with business plans. Mixo offers a generous free tier for testing, paid plans start at $9/month. Over 3 years: approximately $324. Hostinger's base pricing is significantly lower, but Mixo includes better AI features and design quality at its price point. The total cost comparison depends on whether you factor in domain and email - Hostinger includes these, Mixo doesn't. For absolute lowest cost, Hostinger wins. For best experience under $10/month, Mixo provides better value.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do Hostinger and Mixo include hosting?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-teal-600">Both include hosting, different approaches.</strong> Hostinger is primarily a web hosting company that added an AI website builder - hosting is their core business. Reliable infrastructure, free SSL certificates, domain registration and email accounts included. Mixo is a dedicated AI website builder that includes hosting as part of their all-in-one service - hosted on Mixo's infrastructure with SSL included, but no separate email hosting or domain registration. For hosting quality and reliability, Hostinger has the advantage as an established hosting provider. For simplicity and ease, Mixo's all-in-one approach is more straightforward. Choose Hostinger for established hosting with email. Choose Mixo for simpler, focused experience.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can Hostinger or Mixo handle ecommerce?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-teal-600">Neither is ideal for ecommerce, both handle basics.</strong> Hostinger's website builder has basic ecommerce features - products, shopping cart, payment processing via PayPal/Stripe integrations. Limited compared to dedicated ecommerce platforms. Mixo also offers basic ecommerce - product listings, simple checkout, payment processing. But Mixo is primarily for landing pages and simple sites, not full-featured online stores. If you need serious ecommerce (inventory management, complex shipping, multiple payment gateways), look at Shopify or Webflow ecommerce. If you just need to sell a few products or services, both can handle basic ecommerce. For basic ecommerce, Mixo's better designs may convert better. Hostinger's advantage is lower cost for testing.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can I export my website from Hostinger or Mixo?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-teal-600">Neither allows code export - both have vendor lock-in.</strong> Hostinger's website builder doesn't provide code export. Your site is tied to Hostinger's platform and hosting. You can manually recreate elsewhere, but no automated export. Mixo also doesn't offer code export. Your website lives on Mixo's infrastructure with no way to download source code or migrate automatically. This vendor lock-in is the trade-off for convenience and low pricing. If you need platform independence and code export, look at Webflow or Framer instead. If you're okay with vendor lock-in for ease and low pricing, both work well. Just be aware that switching platforms later means rebuilding from scratch.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-teal-600">Mixo has the better free offering.</strong> Mixo offers a genuinely generous free tier - build and publish a site with a mixo.io subdomain at no cost. Fully test the platform, create a real site, see if it works before paying. The free tier has limitations but is functional for testing. Hostinger offers a trial period but not a true free tier - you typically get a money-back guarantee (30 days in most cases) but need to enter payment details to start. Hostinger's approach is traditional free trial rather than free product tier. For risk-free testing without payment details, Mixo's free tier is superior. For testing with refund option, Hostinger's money-back guarantee works.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-teal-600">Mixo has significantly better templates (8.5/10 vs 7.5/10).</strong> Mixo's AI-generated templates are modern, clean, with good typography and spacing - they look professional and trustworthy. The designs feel current and contemporary, not dated. Hostinger's templates are functional but average - they work, but look generic and dated. Boxy layouts, dated styling, nothing that stands out. The template quality difference is one of the main reasons Mixo scores higher overall. If design matters - if you need your site to look professional and credible - Mixo is the clear winner. If you just need something functional and don't care about design aesthetics, Hostinger's templates are adequate. For businesses selling products or services, Mixo's better designs likely convert better.
