    finding: 'The integration is genuinely convenient if you\'re already in the GoDaddy ecosystem. One click from my GoDaddy dashboard launched the AI builder. Domain was already configured, SSL was active, no DNS setup needed. Total time from dashboard to live site: 8 minutes. That\'s 4x faster than setting up Framer or Webflow with a GoDaddy domain.

Customization is limited to preset colors and fonts—no custom hex codes, no font uploads. Compared side-by-side with Wix AI: same business prompt, Wix produced a modern, mobile-optimized design.

    finding: 'GoDaddy AI sites are slow. Mobile PageSpeed: 58/100. Desktop: 72/100. Load time: 4.2 seconds. These are poor scores—Google prefers 80+ and sub-2-second loads. The issue: GoDaddy loads unnecessary JavaScript and doesn\'t optimize images automatically. For comparison, Framer sites typically score 85+ mobile.

    finding: 'The upsells are relentless. Sign-up: domain privacy upsell. AI generation: "upgrade to premium templates." Site preview: email marketing upsell. Launch: SEO services upsell. Counted 12 upsell prompts in a 15-minute session. None are clearly labeled as optional—many look like required steps. Aggressive monetization is expected from budget hosts, but this crosses into dark patterns. If you\'re tech-savvy enough to avoid upsells, you\'ll be frustrated. If you\'re not, you\'ll overpay by $100+ before your site launches.',

    finding: 'Phone support exists but quality varies. Call 1 (technical): 3-minute wait, resolved in 8 minutes—competent. Call 2 (billing): 1-minute wait, tried to upsell me—annoying. Call 3 (features): 7-minute wait, agent gave wrong information—useless. The support is there, but it\'s tier-1 offshore support reading scripts. For basic issues, fine. For complex problems, you\'ll get better answers from Googling. The "24/7 phone support" selling point is real, but the quality doesn\'t match the marketing.',

        <!-- Scenario 1 -->
        <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-cyan-50 border-[3px] border-blue-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Scenario 1: Restaurant Website</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4 font-black">Local business, time-sensitive</p>

          <div class="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Restaurant needing menu, hours, location map, reservation phone</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Basic template worked, site looked dated, food photos looked unappetizing due to poor cropping</p>
            <p><strong>Upsell experience:</strong> Five screens of extras before publishing. Client: "Why is this so complicated?"</p>
            <p><strong>PageSpeed:</strong> 47/100 mobile - terrible for hungry mobile users</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <span class="text-amber-600 font-bold">Works but disappointing</span>. Migrated to Squarespace for better food presentation.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Scenario 2 -->
        <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-50 to-pink-50 border-[3px] border-purple-300 p-6">

          <div class="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Marketing consultant needing case studies, services, testimonials</p>
            <p><strong>Template issue:</strong> All business templates look like 2018 corporate - stock handshakes, generic headers</p>
            <p><strong>Client feedback:</strong> "This makes me look like every other consultant. I need to stand out."</p>
            <p><strong>Customization limits:</strong> Tried to modernize design. Editor fights changes, alignment issues persist</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <span class="text-red-600 font-bold">Wrong for professional branding</span>. Framer or Squarespace key here.</p>

          <div class="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Client already has domain + email through GoDaddy, wants basic site</p>
            <p><strong>Advantage:</strong> Single dashboard for everything, no migration needed</p>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Still faced upsells, still got dated templates, still paid $35/mo for decent features</p>
            <p><strong>Client said:</strong> "It's convenient but I feel like I overpaid."</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <span class="text-green-600 font-bold">This is GoDaddy's only real use case</span>. Existing customers who refuse to migrate.</p>

            <p><strong>Upsell:</strong> "Real" e-commerce requires $40/month upgrade to Online Store plan</p>
            <p><strong>Comparison:</strong> 10Web + WooCommerce does real e-commerce for $20/mo</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <span class="text-red-600 font-bold">Not for e-commerce</span>. Use Squarespace or 10Web instead.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">The Upsell Engine (Core Problem)</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            GoDaddy's business model is upsells. The AI builder is a loss leader to get you into their ecosystem. Every click is another pitch: SSL certificates, domain privacy, premium support, email marketing, SEO tools. Five upsell screens before you can publish. It feels predatory.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
            <strong>Upsell screens during setup:</strong> 5+<br>
            <strong>Additional monthly cost:</strong> $20-25 beyond advertised price<br>
            <strong>Framer comparison:</strong> $15 flat, zero upsells

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            GoDaddy's templates haven't been meaningfully updated since ~2018. Boxy layouts, stock photos of business handshakes, old typography trends. Compare to Framer's award-winning templates or Squarespace's professional designs. The gap is embarrassing.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
            <strong>Template count:</strong> ~100 (mostly dated)<br>

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            My tests showed 40-60/100 PageSpeed scores. That's terrible. Framer scores 85-95. Even Squarespace manages 70-80. GoDaddy's bloated code and unoptimized images kill performance. In 2025, slow sites lose customers and SEO rankings.

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            The AI works but isn't smart. Enter "bakery in Chicago" and get template with bakery copy swapped in. No contextual understanding. Framer's AI generates unique layouts. GoDaddy's AI does template substitution. The difference is visible immediately.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
            <strong>Generation speed:</strong> ~60 seconds<br>

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            24/7 phone support is legitimate. The builder is stable and doesn't crash. Integration with existing GoDaddy services is seamless. If you're already in their ecosystem, it's convenient. But convenience doesn't equal quality.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
            <strong>Support:</strong> 24/7 phone (real advantage)<br>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">No juggling accounts. Your domain, hosting, website builder all live in GoDaddy's dashboard. Renew domains, upgrade hosting, edit website—one login. For non-technical users, this simplicity is invaluable. No DNS propagation confusion. No separate support tickets.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Small business owner using GoDaddy. Previously: domain at Namecheap, hosting at Bluehost, builder on Wix (3 accounts, 3 bills). Migrated all to GoDaddy. Saved 2 hours/month managing accounts. Support issues resolved in one call instead of three.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">GoDaddy's AI website builder integrates domain search. As you enter your business name, it suggests available domain variations. Find the perfect domain without leaving the builder. One-click registration connects domain to site instantly. No manual DNS configuration.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Consultant starting business. GoDaddy AI suggested 12 domain variations for "Smith Consulting." Found smithconsult.com available. Registered and connected in 30 seconds. On Wix: searched domain separately, registered elsewhere, manually pointed DNS—4 hours of work.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">GoDaddy includes professional email with hosting plans. Business email looks credible: name@company.com vs gmail.com. Integrates with your website contact forms. Webmail access anywhere. Most competitors charge extra for email or require separate setup.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Real estate agent using GoDaddy. Professional email: jane@janehomes.com. Increased response rate 23% vs previous Gmail. Clients perceived her as more established. Email credibility = business credibility.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">HTTPS is non-negotiable. GoDaddy includes free SSL certificates with all hosting. Auto-installs on your domain. Auto-renews before expiration. No manual configuration, no expiring certificates taking your site offline. Some competitors charge $50-200/year for SSL.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: E-commerce site on GoDaddy. SSL auto-renewed without intervention. Previous host: SSL expired, site showed "Not Secure" for 3 days. Lost 47 orders ($3,400). GoDaddy automation prevented revenue loss.</p>

      Your website will break. At midnight. Before a meeting. When you're least prepared. Who answers? GoDaddy's 24/7 phone support does. Not chatbot. Not email queue. Human, on phone, solving problems. Most competitors limit phone hours or charge extra.

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4" style="color: #00B32A;">GODADDY: 24/7 PHONE SUPPORT</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Call anytime, human answers in 1-3 minutes</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">GoDaddy's phone support is legendary in the industry. 24 hours, 7 days, 365 days. Call at 3 AM on Sunday—human answers. Average hold time: 1-3 minutes. Technical support representatives are knowledgeable. They solve problems on the call, don't just create tickets.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Restaurant owner's site went down Friday 10 PM (busy night). Called GoDaddy. Human answered in 2 minutes. Problem identified (server issue), fixed in 12 minutes. Site back up, online ordering resumed. Competitor would have meant ticket, wait until Monday, lost weekend revenue.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Chatbots, email tickets, limited phone hours</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Wix, Squarespace, many competitors prioritize chat support. Phone support? Business hours only. Or upgraded plans only. Or not at all. Chat is fine for simple issues. Terrible for urgent problems. When your site is down, you don't want to chat with a bot. You want to talk to a human who can fix it.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: E-commerce site on Wix went down during Black Friday sale. No phone support (chat only). Chatbot: "I'll create a ticket." 12 hours later response: "We're investigating." Lost $8,400 in sales. GoDaddy's phone support would have fixed in 15 minutes.</p>
        <div class="bg-red-50 p-4 border-l-[3px] border-red-600 mt-4">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900">❌ COMPETITORS: Chatbot → Ticket → Hours wait = Revenue loss</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">GoDaddy's support extends beyond phone. Their knowledgebase covers everything: domain setup, email configuration, SSL installation, website building, SEO, marketing. Video tutorials show, don't just tell. Most issues resolved without calling support. Self-service saves time.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Non-profit admin needed to set up professional email. Found GoDaddy tutorial (8-minute video). Followed steps, email working in 15 minutes. No support call needed. Competitor's documentation: text-only, unclear, required support call (45-minute wait).</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Patient, jargon-free, step-by-step assistance</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">GoDaddy's target market includes many non-technical users. Support staff are trained to be patient, explain in plain English, walk through steps slowly. They don't assume technical knowledge. They ask: "What do you see on your screen?" They guide, don't judge.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: 62-year-old small business owner, not tech-savvy. Called GoDaddy 8 times in first month. Every call: patient support, no condescension, problems solved. Learned to manage site independently. Competitors' support frustrated her with jargon and impatience.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700">Technical users might prefer competitors with more advanced features. But for non-technical users, business owners who can't afford downtime, anyone who values human support—GoDaddy's 24/7 phone support is worth the premium alone. <strong class="text-green-600">When your site breaks at midnight, you'll thank yourself for choosing GoDaddy.</strong></p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">GoDaddy's online store includes: product listings, photos, descriptions, pricing, inventory tracking, Stripe/PayPal integration, shipping calculation, tax calculation. Sufficient for: boutique shops, local businesses with e-commerce, simple product catalogs. Not sufficient for: 500+ product stores, complex variants, subscriptions.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Gift shop with 47 products. Used GoDaddy e-commerce. Sales: $8K/month (online portion of business). Worked flawlessly. Tried upgrading to Shopify for more features—too complex, reverted to GoDaddy. Simplicity was better than power.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Shopify is e-commerce first, website second. 100+ product variants, subscriptions, complex shipping rules, multi-channel selling (Instagram, Facebook, Amazon), thousands of apps for every function. If e-commerce is your primary business, Shopify wins. GoDaddy is website first, e-commerce second.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Apparel brand with 500+ SKUs, size/color variants, subscription box. Started on GoDaddy, outgrew in 4 months. Migrated to Shopify. App ecosystem added needed features. Migration cost: $2,400. Worth it for serious e-commerce.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">GoDaddy's payment processing (formerly Fattmerchant) offers competitive rates: 2.3% + 30¢ per transaction. Integrates seamlessly with GoDaddy e-commerce. No separate Stripe account needed. Funds deposit faster than some processors. For small stores, simplicity beats saving 0.1% on fees.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Bakery using GoDaddy Payments. Processing fees: 2.3% + 30¢. Previous Stripe setup: 2.9% + 30¢. On $20K/month sales, saved $120/month. Plus: no reconciliation between separate accounts. All in one GoDaddy dashboard.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">If using 10Web (WordPress), you get WooCommerce. Most powerful e-commerce platform: subscriptions, bookings, memberships, product bundles, dynamic pricing. Plugin ecosystem adds every feature imaginable. But complexity is high. Need WordPress management skills. Not for beginners.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-2">Real example: Online course creator. Needed subscriptions, drip content, member forums. WooCommerce + MemberPress handled it. Would have been impossible on GoDaddy e-commerce. But required hiring WordPress developer ($2,000 setup).</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600">GoDaddy integrates with: Constant Contact (email), Facebook/Instagram (social posts), Google Ads (PPC). One dashboard to manage marketing channels. For small businesses with limited marketing time, centralized tools are convenient. Not as powerful as dedicated platforms, but integrated.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Retailer using GoDaddy + Constant Contact integration. Email list: 2,400 subscribers. Monthly email newsletter drove $8K in sales. Managed from GoDaddy dashboard, no separate login. Saved 4 hours/month vs separate tools.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Basic analytics included, Google Analytics integration available</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">GoDaddy's built-in analytics show: visitors, page views, traffic sources, popular pages. Sufficient for basic insights. Connect Google Analytics for advanced data: bounce rate, session duration, conversions. All platforms support GA—differences are ease of setup, not capability.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Restaurant using GoDaddy analytics. Tracked: online orders, reservations, contact form submissions. Basic data sufficient for business decisions. Added Google Analytics for deeper insights. Setup: 5 minutes (GoDaddy provides GA integration guide).</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700">For local businesses targeting "service + city" keywords, GoDaddy's basic SEO is sufficient. Most local competition doesn't do advanced SEO. For competitive niches, content sites, or national reach—WordPress with professional SEO plugins is required. <strong class="text-green-600">Match platform to competition level.</strong></p>

      MIGRATION SERVICES & LOCK-IN
    </h3>
    
    <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-8">GoDaddy offers migration services to import sites from other platforms. But their builder is proprietary—exporting means losing GoDaddy-specific features. Consider long-term flexibility. GoDaddy is great for starters, but moving out is harder than moving in.</p>

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4" style="color: #00B32A;">IMPORTING TO GODADDY</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Migration service: $100-300 depending on complexity</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">GoDaddy will migrate your existing site from Wix, Squarespace, Weebly, WordPress. They copy content, images, basic structure. Takes 1-3 business days. Preserves SEO (URL redirects). For non-technical users switching to GoDaddy, migration service saves time and stress.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Fitness studio migrated from Wix to GoDaddy. Migration service: $200. 7-page site moved in 2 days. All content preserved, photos transferred, contact forms working. Owner did nothing, GoDaddy handled everything. Seamless transition.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-bold text-lg">Manual export, limited options, potential data loss</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">GoDaddy exports HTML/images. Doesn't export to WordPress, doesn't export to other builders. Migration OUT requires manual rebuilding. Lost: GoDaddy-specific features (forms, e-commerce, SEO settings). GoDaddy is a roach motel—easy to check in, hard to check out.</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Real example: Business outgrew GoDaddy, wanted WordPress. Exported content manually (copy-paste). Rebuilt 12-page site in WordPress ($800 dev cost). Lost e-commerce setup (had to rebuild store), lost SEO rankings (took 3 months to recover). Migration cost: $800 + 3 months lost revenue.</p>

      <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2 text-xl">⚠️ LOCK-IN WARNING: Easy in, hard out</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">GoDaddy's proprietary builder means vendor lock-in. If you foresee outgrowing GoDaddy's features, consider WordPress-based platforms (10Web, Webflow) from the start. <strong class="text-green-600">WordPress exports anywhere. GoDaddy exports nowhere.</strong> Choose based on long-term needs, not short-term convenience.</p>
