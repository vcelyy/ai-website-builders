          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Most AI website builders do NOT have native MLS integration. For MLS integration, WordPress with plugins like MLS Import or IDX is the best option. Some workarounds exist: Wix has third-party apps through their marketplace, Webflow allows custom integrations via API, and some dedicated real estate website builders offer native MLS. For most agents using AI builders, manually adding featured properties is common practice. If MLS integration is essential, consider WordPress over AI builders, or use a dedicated real estate platform."

Wix offers Wix Forms with email automation. Squarespace integrates with email marketing tools. Best practices include: place inquiry buttons on every property listing, offer property alerts by email, provide home valuation tools, capture buyer information before revealing full details, and use scheduling tools for viewing appointments.

          "text": "AI website builders for real estate cost $15-65/month. Squarespace starts at $23/month, Wix at $16/month, Framer at $15/month, Durable at $15/month. Professional real estate websites from agencies cost $5,000-20,000 upfront plus $100-500/month for maintenance. AI builders include hosting, SSL, and built-in features. Custom sites require separate hosting ($20-100/month), SSL ($50-200/year), and ongoing maintenance costs. Most agents can launch professional sites with AI builders for under $500 total (first year). The key difference: AI builders are DIY but include everything. Custom sites require agencies but offer full customization."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Video tours reduce wasted in-person showings by 40% while closing 2.1x more deals. Video filters out tire-kickers—serious buyers still want to see properties in person, but casual browsers can eliminate properties through video. Property walkthrough videos, neighborhood tours, and agent introduction videos all build trust. Video content doesn't need to be cinematic—iPhone footage is fine. Consistency matters more than quality: one video per listing is better than one perfect video per year. Platforms: YouTube (free hosting, embed anywhere), Vimeo (better quality, $20-70/month), or self-hosted (more control, more technical)."

    <!-- THE BRUTAL TRUTH -->

        <p class="text-xs text-gray-400 uppercase tracking-wider font-black mb-2">THE BRUTAL TRUTH</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black mb-6">Most Real Estate Websites Are Digital Ghost Towns</h2>

        <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-300">
          <p>
            Agents spend thousands on Zillow, Realtor.com, and lead generation services. Their own websites sit neglected, updated once every 6 months, collecting digital dust.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is backward. Your website is the only online real estate you truly own. Zillow can change algorithms. Realtor.com can increase prices. Your website is your permanent asset—if you build it right.
          </p>

          <p>
            Real estate is hyper-local. Win "Miami Beach luxury real estate" on Google and you own that market. Win "South Beach condos" and "Coconut Grove waterfront" and you dominate multiple neighborhoods. Each neighborhood page is a new organic search entry point.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most agents compete on national platforms where everyone looks the same. Smart agents build local authority where no one else is competing. Your website should generate your best leads—qualified, local, serious.
          </p>

          <p>
            The agents winning online aren't spending the most. They're creating the most value: neighborhood guides, market reports, sold property showcases, video tours. They're building resources, not just brochures.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What is the best AI website builder for real estate agents?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Squarespace (8.8/10) is best for image-focused realtors with beautiful property showcases and excellent image galleries. Wix (8.5/10) offers property listing templates, booking systems for viewings, and lead capture forms. Framer (8.3/10) delivers stunning property presentations with smooth animations for design-conscious agents. Durable (8.0/10) provides fastest setup with built-in CRM for lead management. Choose Squarespace for property photography, Wix for full-featured sites, Framer for modern aesthetics, or Durable for quick launch with CRM.</p>

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Can AI website builders integrate with MLS?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Most AI website builders do NOT have native MLS integration. For MLS integration, WordPress with plugins like MLS Import or IDX is the best option. Some workarounds exist: Wix has third-party apps through their marketplace, Webflow allows custom integrations via API, and some dedicated real estate website builders offer native MLS. For most agents using AI builders, manually adding featured properties is common practice. If MLS integration is essential, consider WordPress over AI builders, or use a dedicated real estate platform.</p>

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How do real estate agents capture leads with AI builders?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">All AI builders offer lead capture through contact forms and inquiry buttons. For advanced lead management: Durable includes built-in CRM for tracking and following up with leads. Wix offers Wix Forms with email automation. Squarespace integrates with email marketing tools. Best practices include: place inquiry buttons on every property listing, offer property alerts by email, provide home valuation tools, capture buyer information before revealing full details, and use scheduling tools for viewing appointments. For sophisticated lead nurturing, consider connecting to CRM tools like HubSpot or using Durable's built-in CRM.</p>

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How much does a real estate agent website cost?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">AI website builders for real estate cost $15-65/month. Squarespace starts at $23/month, Wix at $16/month, Framer at $15/month, Durable at $15/month. Professional real estate websites from agencies cost $5,000-20,000 upfront plus $100-500/month for maintenance. AI builders include hosting, SSL, and built-in features. Custom sites require separate hosting ($20-100/month), SSL ($50-200/year), and ongoing maintenance costs. Most agents can launch professional sites with AI builders for under $500 total (first year). The key difference: AI builders are DIY but include everything. Custom sites require agencies but offer full customization.</p>

        <div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should real estate agents use video on their websites?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Video tours reduce wasted in-person showings by 40% while closing 2.1x more deals. Video filters out tire-kickers—serious buyers still want to see properties in person, but casual browsers can eliminate properties through video. Property walkthrough videos, neighborhood tours, and agent introduction videos all build trust. Video content doesn't need to be cinematic—iPhone footage is fine. Consistency matters more than quality: one video per listing is better than one perfect video per year. Platforms: YouTube (free hosting, embed anywhere), Vimeo (better quality, $20-70/month), or self-hosted (more control, more technical).</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What real estate website features convert visitors into leads?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">High-converting real estate websites include: (1) Property search or filters for quick browsing, (2) High-quality photo galleries (professional photos only), (3) 'Recently Sold' section to prove competence, (4) Clear CTAs on every listing ('Schedule Viewing' not 'Learn More'), (5) Mobile-optimized design (91% of traffic is mobile), (6) Neighborhood information (schools, amenities, commute), (7) Client testimonials with actual results, (8) Home valuation tools to capture seller leads, (9) Live chat or quick-contact options, (10) Fast load times (under 3 seconds). The most overlooked feature: 'Recently Sold' properties. Listings show what you're selling. Sold listings show you can actually sell.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How do I optimize my real estate website for local SEO?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Real estate is hyper-local. Your SEO should be too. Strategies: (1) Create neighborhood pages for each area you serve ('Homes in [Neighborhood]'), (2) Optimize for long-tail keywords ('3 bedroom homes [City] under $500k'), (3) Get listed on local business directories with consistent NAP (name, address, phone), (4) Encourage Google reviews from past clients, (5) Create local content: market reports, neighborhood guides, local events, (6) Use schema markup for properties and business info, (7) Build local backlinks from community organizations, (8) Optimize Google Business Profile with photos and posts, (9) Include virtual office address if you work remotely, (10) Track 'near me' searches in your area. Most agents rank nationally but ignore hyper-local. Win your neighborhood first.</p>
