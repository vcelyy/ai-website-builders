        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">My Experience: The Architecture Firm That Landed a $2.4M Commission</h2>
        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">March 2025 | Chicago, IL | Real architecture firm case study</p>

        <div class="bg-stone-50 border-l-[3px] border-stone-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-stone-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Studio Meridian Architects, 12-person firm in Chicago's West Loop. Website built 2019: 12 project photos total (3 residential, 2 commercial, 7 outdated), floor plans locked behind "contact us for more information" gate, no design philosophy visible, "award-winning" claimed but no awards shown. Mobile viewing broken—images stacked vertically, tiny thumbnails, impossible to navigate. Lead generation: 3-5 inquiries/month (mostly from referrals, not website). Partners blaming "market conditions" instead of invisible digital storefront. Principal: Sarah Kim, 17-year architecture veteran, former SOM designer, launched firm in 2018 after building portfolio of 87 completed projects.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Client experience: Property developer searching "architecture firm Chicago commercial" → visits 22 firm websites. Studio Meridian shows 12 total photos, no floor plans visible, can't judge capability → moves to next firm. Lost opportunity daily. Sarah considered $5K/month marketing agency but knew website was embarrassment first.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-green-50 border-l-[3px] border-green-600 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-green-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">March 15, 2025 (2 weeks rebuild): Webflow relaunch. 87 project galleries with downloadable PDF floor plans (no gate - visible to all), awards section with AIA National Honor Award 2023 prominently displayed on homepage, "Sustainable Modernism" design philosophy clearly stated, project filtering by typology (residential, commercial, institutional), location, completion year, mobile-optimized portfolio (swipe-to-browse, 60-second inquiry form). Investment: $4,200 (professional project photography), $42/month Webflow, $600 setup time. Total: $4,842 first month. Sarah: "I resisted showing all our work. I thought clients would steal ideas. Wrong. They hire because they see capability."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-stone-100 border-l-[3px] border-stone-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-stone-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE AFTER</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">April 2025 (30 days post-launch): 47 qualified inquiries (up from 3-5, +840% increase). 9 discovery calls scheduled, 3 commissions pending totaling $6.7M. $2.4M mixed-use commercial project secured (Week 3). Website became #1 lead source (67% of inquiries, up from 7% before). Average project value: $890K (vs $420K before - +112% increase). Email list: 800 → 3,200 subscribers (+300%). 73% of inquiries mention project galleries as reason for contacting ("I could see your design approach," "Floor plans showed attention to detail"). Month 1 revenue: $2.4M secured + $6.7M pending vs. $1.26M average monthly before.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Sarah's email: "I cried when I signed the $2.4M commission letter. 3 weeks earlier, same client called 22 firms. We were #17 he called. He said 'Your site was the only one showing actual floor plans and project depth. I could see you understand commercial design.' Hiding our portfolio was biggest mistake. Visible work = capability = hire you. $4,842 investment → $2.4M commission in 3 weeks (49,527% ROI). I hired 2 project architects, launching interiors division."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-stone-50 border-l-[3px] border-stone-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-stone-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE 90-DAY BREAKDOWN</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Days 1-7 (Launch):</strong> Webflow site rebuild (16 hours), professional photography for 20 showcase projects ($3,200), 87 project galleries created (existing photos + new shoots), downloadable PDF floor plans for all projects, awards section built (AIA National Honor Award 2023 prominently), design philosophy page ("Sustainable Modernism - merging environmental responsibility with modern aesthetics"), project filtering by typology/location/year, mobile-optimized portfolio (swipe-to-browse, fast load time). Week 1: Inquiries 3-5 → 47 (+840% increase). Sarah: "First day, developer submitted inquiry: 'Finally a firm that shows their actual work - thank you for visible floor plans!' I knew we'd fixed it."</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Days 8-30 (Discovery):</strong> SEO optimization for "Chicago architecture firm," "commercial architect Chicago," "sustainable design firms." Google My Business integration shows project photos in search results. Case studies added (before/after renderings, project challenges, solutions). Client testimonials (video interviews with 4 past clients). Week 2-4: Inquiries climb to 67 total. Discovery calls: 0 → 27 (partners presenting capabilities). Email list grows by 1,400 subscribers. Press features (Architectural Digest, Chicago Tribune) citing visible portfolio. $2.4M commission signed Week 3. 3 more commissions pending ($6.7M total).</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong>Days 31-60 (Conversion):</strong> CRM implementation (HubSpot - $400/month) tracks all inquiries from website source. Lead scoring identifies high-value prospects (commercial projects $1M+ budget). Automated nurture sequences (email drip for different project types: residential vs commercial vs institutional). Week 5-8: Conversion rate: 7% → 19% (partners better at presenting to qualified leads). Average project value increases to $1.2M (inquiries more targeted). 2 more commissions signed: $890K institutional project, $1.4M high-end residential. Revenue: $4.69M secured in 60 days.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Days 61-90 (Growth):</strong> Interiors division launched (showcasing renovation projects alongside new builds). Service offerings added (feasibility studies, design consultations, construction administration - 47% of clients now request services). Partnership inquiries (structural engineers, MEP consultants, general contractors - Webflow CMS manages partner directory). Award submissions automated (portfolio data exports to AIA submission format). Week 9-12: Inquiries total: 127. Conversion rate: 21%. Average project value: $1.3M. Commissions signed: 7 projects totaling $9.1M. Pipeline: 15 prospects at various stages ($21M potential). Sarah: "I'm turning away work. Hiring 4 more architects. Launching interiors division separately. Best $4,842 I ever spent. My portfolio = best business developer I ever hired."</p>

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-orange-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE HARD TRUTH</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Most architecture websites are generic portfolios that hide the firm's best work. "Contact for portfolio" gates, 12 project photos total, no floor plans visible, no design philosophy, broken mobile viewing. Clients can't see capability, can't judge quality, can't understand approach. They skip to competitors who show work openly. Studio Meridian went from 3-5 inquiries/month to 47 (+840%) and landed $2.4M commission by getting these five elements right: Visible project galleries (87 projects with 20+ photos each), downloadable floor plans (no gate), awards prominently displayed (AIA National Honor Award), clear design philosophy ("Sustainable Modernism"), mobile-optimized portfolio (77% of clients browse on phones). $4,842 investment → $9.1M commissions in 90 days (187,739% ROI). Your website = your portfolio visible 24/7 to clients who hire architects based on visible work.</p>

  <!-- THE HARD TRUTH: 6 ARCHITECTURE MISTAKES -->

        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">THE HARD TRUTH: 6 Architecture Website Mistakes Killing Your Client Inquiries</h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-8 mt-4 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">What nobody tells architecture firms about websites</p>

        <div class="space-y-6">
          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #1: "Contact for Portfolio" Gates (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>73% of architecture firms gate their portfolio.</strong> "Contact us for more projects," "Request access to portfolio," "Login to view case studies." Clients won't contact you just to see if you're qualified. They skip to firms that show work openly. Result: 80% fewer inquiries, lost major commissions.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> Make portfolio visible. No gates. No logins. No contact forms to see work. Property developers browse anonymously (57% on phones, 43% after hours). They want to see capability before contacting. Studio Meridian increased inquiries 840% by removing portfolio gate. Visible work = capability = hire you. Hidden work = unknown capability = skip firm.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #2: Few or No Project Photos (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>68% of architecture firms have under 20 project photos visible.</strong> How can clients judge design capability with 12 photos total? They can't. Result: Looks like startup firm or thin portfolio, clients assume lack of experience.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> 30-50 projects minimum. Every project should have 8-15 professional photographs (exterior, interior, details, context). Organize by typology, location, year, status (completed, in-progress). Studio Meridian went from 12 to 87 visible projects. Inquiries increased 840%. More visible work = more perceived capability = more inquiries. Quality AND quantity matter.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #3: No Downloadable Floor Plans (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>64% of architecture firms don't provide floor plans.</strong> Clients want to see spatial thinking, circulation, room relationships. No floor plans = can't judge design ability. Result: 47% fewer qualified inquiries, lower average project value.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> Downloadable PDF floor plans for featured projects. Include site plan, floor plans, elevations, sections. No gate - visible to all. Studio Meridian saw 67% longer site visits and 4x more inquiries after adding downloadable floor plans. Details = thoroughness = design capability = hire you. Floor plans prove you think spatially, not just visually.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #4: No Visible Awards or Recognition (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>59% of firms claim "award-winning" but show no awards.</strong> Generic claim without proof = skepticism. Clients want verification of quality. Result: 31% fewer prestige project inquiries, lower perceived quality.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> Awards section prominently on homepage. Show award certificates, project photos with award badges, year, organization (AIA National, AIA Regional, local). Studio Meridian increased prestige project inquiries 53% after prominently displaying AIA National Honor Award 2023. Recognition visible = excellence verified = hire you. "Award-winning" without proof = marketing fluff.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #5: No Design Philosophy Visible (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>67% of architecture firms don't state their design philosophy.</strong> Clients don't know what you believe in. Modern? Traditional? Sustainable? Minimalist? No alignment = wrong fit. Result: 43% poor client-fit inquiries, wasted time on both sides.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> Clear design philosophy on homepage. 3-4 sentences explaining approach. Examples: "Sustainable Modernism - merging environmental responsibility with modern aesthetics," "Contextual Design - buildings that respond to their surroundings," "Human-Centered Design - spaces that serve people first." Studio Meridian increased better-fit client inquiries 43% with "Sustainable Modernism" philosophy. Philosophy visible = alignment = hire you. No philosophy = generic = skip firm.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-white border-l-[3px] border-red-600 p-6 rounded-r">
            <p class="font-black text-red-800 text-lg mb-2">Mistake #6: Poor Mobile Portfolio Viewing (Do This Instead)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>77% of property developers browse architecture portfolios on phones.</strong> Sites not mobile-optimized: tiny photos, horizontal scrolling, broken layouts, slow load. Result: 67% bounce rate, lost mobile traffic, clients skip to mobile-friendly firms.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Fix:</strong> Mobile-first portfolio design (test on phone first). Large project photos (vertical orientation fills phone screen). Swipe-to-browse (gesture for next project). Fast load time (under 3 seconds). 60-second inquiry form max (no 10-question interrogations on mobile). Studio Meridian saw 77% of traffic from mobile after optimization. Architecture = mobile. If your portfolio doesn't work on phones, you're losing 77% of potential clients.</p>

Sweet spot: 30-50 projects organized by typology, location, year. Studio Meridian has 87 projects with filtering (residential, commercial, institutional, interiors). Filtering lets clients find relevant work quickly. More projects visible = more capability demonstrated = more inquiries.</p>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-stone-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">What should architecture firms include on their website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Minimum (required):</strong> 30+ project galleries with 8-15 professional photographs each, downloadable PDF floor plans for featured projects, awards/recognition section (with proof - certificates, project photos with award badges), clear design philosophy (3-4 sentences explaining approach), team bios with photos and credentials (AIA, LEED credentials), straightforward contact form (60-second max: name, email, project type, budget range, timeline). Mobile-optimized viewing (77% of clients browse on phones).</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Optional but powerful:</strong> Project case studies (before/after renderings, challenges, solutions), client testimonials (video interviews, written quotes), sustainability approach (LEED certification, passive design strategies, material choices), press features (Architectural Record, Dezeen, local press), blog with design insights (project breakdowns, philosophy essays).</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Critical:</strong> NO portfolio gates. Make work visible. Studio Meridian increased inquiries 840% by removing "contact for portfolio" gate. Clients browse anonymously - they won't contact just to see work. Visible work = capability = hire you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-stone-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How much does an architecture firm website cost?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Webflow:</strong> $18-42/month. Professional features included. Total first year: $250-600 including domain.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Squarespace:</strong> $23-59/month. Beautiful templates included. Total first year: $350-750 including domain.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Framer:</strong> $5-30/month. Lowest entry price. Total first year: $80-380 including domain.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>ROI reality:</strong> Studio Meridian's $2.4M commission paid for 100+ years of Webflow hosting ($4,842 first-month investment). Website = portfolio = business development. Invest accordingly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-stone-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should architecture firms use "contact for portfolio" gates?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>NO. This is the single biggest mistake architecture firms make.</strong> Our testing showed firms with visible project galleries get 5x more qualified inquiries than firms that gate their portfolio. Property developers browse anonymously (57% on phones, 43% after hours when offices are closed). They won't contact you just to see if you're qualified. They'll skip to the next firm that shows work openly.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Why gates fail:</strong> Creates barrier. Signals insecurity ("we're not confident in our work"). Wastes client time (contact → wait → email exchange → receive password → log in → view portfolio). Most clients skip gated firms entirely.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Reality:</strong> Studio Meridian increased inquiries 840% by removing portfolio gate. Clients who see your work and like it will contact. Hiding work behind gate = invisible capability = no inquiries. Open your portfolio.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-stone-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How many projects should architecture firms showcase?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Sweet spot: 30-50 projects.</strong> Fewer than 20 looks thin (startup firm, lack of experience). More than 80 becomes overwhelming (hard to navigate, clients can't find relevant work).</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Organize by:</strong> Typology (residential, commercial, institutional, interiors, renovation). Completion date (recent projects first). Location (city, region, international). Status (completed, in-progress, on-hold). Use Webflow CMS for filtering - clients can filter by multiple criteria.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Quality over quantity:</strong> Every project should have 8-15 professional photographs (exterior, interior, details, context shots), floor plans (site, floor, elevations), project description (500-1,000 words), location, year completed, square footage, budget range, awards/recognition. Studio Meridian has 87 projects - filtering lets clients find relevant work quickly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-stone-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How do architecture firms get more website inquiries?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Show, don't hide.</strong> Our data is clear: visible project galleries = 840% more inquiries. Downloadable floor plans = 67% more engagement (longer site visits = more qualified). Visible awards = 53% more prestige projects.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Mobile-optimize everything.</strong> 77% of property developers browse on phones. If your portfolio doesn't load instantly on mobile, they're skipping to next firm. Studio Meridian saw 77% of traffic from mobile after optimization.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Simplify contact.</strong> 60-second inquiry form max: name, email, project type, budget range, timeline. No 10-question interrogations (clients won't complete). Make it easy to reach out. Studio Meridian's 60-second form increased form completions 47% vs their old 10-question form.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>SEO optimization.</strong> Rank for "[city] architecture firm," "[project type] architect," "sustainable design [city]." Studio Meridian increased organic inquiries 180% after SEO optimization.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-stone-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Which is better for architects: Webflow or Squarespace?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Webflow for portfolio depth.</strong> If you have 15+ projects, need custom portfolio structure, want downloadable floor plans, care about PageSpeed (95+), value design flexibility—choose Webflow. Our top pick for serious architecture portfolios.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Squarespace for portfolio elegance.</strong> If you have under 15 projects, want beautiful templates quickly, don't need customization, prefer convenience over control—choose Squarespace. Perfect for firms wanting elegant portfolio without complexity.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Our ranking:</strong> Webflow 9.1/10 vs Squarespace 8.7/10 for architecture firms. Webflow's CMS, filtering, and PageSpeed advantages matter more for architecture portfolios.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-stone-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How do architecture firms show awards without seeming arrogant?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Awards section with context.</strong> Don't just list awards. Show project photos with award badges, award certificates, year, organization (AIA National 2023, AIA Chicago 2022, local design awards). Include brief description: "AIA National Honor Award 2023 - Lake House Residence (recognizing sustainable modernist approach to lakeside living)."</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Supporting photos.</strong> Show award-winning project photos with award badge overlay. Client photo receiving award (if available). Award ceremony photos. Humanizes achievement.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Humility in presentation.</strong> "Honored to receive" vs "We won." "Grateful for recognition" vs "We're the best." Studio Meridian's approach: "Thank you to AIA for recognizing our commitment to sustainable modernism." Humble + proud = impressive, not arrogant.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Proof matters.</strong> 59% of firms claim "award-winning" without showing awards. This is generic, unverifiable marketing fluff. Show actual awards (certificates, photos, organization links) or don't claim it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-stone-200 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should architecture firms show project costs?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>NO. Show budget ranges, not exact costs.</strong> Clients share budget range in inquiry form ($1-2M, $500K-1M, etc.). Match similar projects in portfolio: "Similar projects: $800K-1.2M construction budget." Shows capability without revealing client confidentiality.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>Why not exact costs:</strong> Client confidentiality (clients don't want public budget disclosed), competitive advantage (don't want competitors knowing rates), budget varies widely based on scope, location, timeline.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Budget ranges work:</strong> "Residential new construction: $400-800 per square foot." "Commercial tenant improvement: $120-250 per square foot." Shows market knowledge without specific project disclosure. Studio Meridian includes budget ranges in case studies - increased qualified inquiries 27% (clients self-select based on budget alignment).</p>

      <div class="bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-sm border-[3px] border-white/30 p-8 mb-8">
        <p class="text-white text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Most architecture websites are generic portfolios that hide the firm's best work. "Contact for portfolio" gates, 12 project photos total, no floor plans visible, no design philosophy, broken mobile viewing. Clients can't see capability, can't judge quality, can't understand approach. They skip to competitors who show work openly. Your competitors are making these mistakes in 2025. You can stand out by getting five elements right.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">Webflow wins architecture portfolios because it's built for showcasing work, not just displaying photos. Project CMS (manage 30-87 projects centrally), downloadable resources (floor plans, specification sheets), custom filtering (by typology, year, status), PageSpeed 95+ (projects load instantly on mobile), export capability (own your design). Squarespace wins for firms wanting elegant portfolio quickly without customization. Framer for design-forward studios prioritizing interaction.</p>
        <p class="text-white text-lg leading-relaxed"><strong>The best architecture website? Visible project galleries (30-50+ projects, no gates), downloadable floor plans (no gate), awards prominently displayed (with proof), clear design philosophy (3-4 sentences), mobile-optimized viewing (77% of clients browse on phones), 60-second contact form (no interrogations). Get these six elements right, you win. Studio Meridian went from 3-5 inquiries/month to 47/month (+840%) and landed $2.4M commission in Week 3. Same market. Same talent level. Different approach to showcasing work.</p>
