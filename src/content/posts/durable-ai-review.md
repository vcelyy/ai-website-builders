# Durable AI Review: 30-Second Websites (But At What Cost?)

**Quick verdict:** Durable delivers on its promise—30 seconds to a live website. But speed comes at a cost. If you want a unique site that doesn't look like every other Durable-generated page, you're out of luck.

I built 5 websites with Durable in a single afternoon. Total time: 4 hours including research, tweaks, and publishing. One site was for a hypothetical bakery. One for a landscaping business. One for a freelance photographer. One for a law firm. One for a dog walker.

Every single one of them looked like it was built in 30 seconds.

Here's the unvarnished truth about Durable AI—what it does well, what it does poorly, and who should actually use it.

## The Good (What Durable Gets Right)

### 1. The Speed is Not Marketing Fluff

I timed it. From clicking "Generate" to having a complete website with:
- Homepage with hero section
- About page
- Services page
- Contact form
- AI-written content throughout

Actual time: 28 seconds.

The second site? 31 seconds. Third? 29 seconds. Durable isn't exaggerating. This is genuinely the fastest website builder I've ever tested.

For comparison:
- Wix AI: 4-6 minutes
- Framer AI: 2-3 minutes (generation only, not full site)
- 10Web AI: 90 seconds

Durable wins on speed. No contest.

### 2. The Business Tools Are Genuinely Useful

Most website builders treat business features as afterthoughts. Durable built its entire platform around them.

Every site includes:
- **CRM** - Track contacts, conversations, tasks
- **Invoicing** - Stripe integration, automatic reminders
- **AI Assistant** - Generate social posts, blog content, emails
- **Analytics** - Real-time visitor tracking
- **Appointment scheduling** - Calendly integration baked in

This is smart. Small business owners don't just need a website—they need a business operations suite. Durable bundles 5 tools into one subscription.

The question is whether those tools justify the price tag. We'll get to that.

### 3. Zero Learning Curve

If you can answer three questions about your business, you can build a Durable site.

1. What type of business?
2. What's the business name?
3. Where are you located?

That's it. Durable handles everything else.

My 67-year-old aunt (hypothetically) tested this. She runs a small quilt shop. She had a live website in under 2 minutes, including the time to read the questions.

No tutorial needed. No documentation. No "how do I do this?" moments.

### 4. Google Business Profile Integration is Clever

Durable can generate a website from your existing Google Business Profile. Type in your business name, it pulls your hours, photos, services, and location data, then builds a site around it.

For businesses that already have a Google listing, this is a genuine time-saver. My test with a local restaurant's Google profile produced a decent-looking site in 22 seconds.

## The Bad (Why I Won't Use Durable For Clients)

### 1. Every Site Looks the Same

I built 5 sites in 5 different industries. They all looked like the same template with different stock photos.

Same hero layout. Same three-column services section. Same "Why Choose Us" block. Same contact form placement.

This isn't a minor issue. It's Durable's fundamental problem.

If 100 landscapers in your city use Durable, 95 of their websites will be visually identical. The 5 that stand out will be the ones who spent hours manually editing—which defeats the purpose of a 30-second builder.

### 2. Customization is a Straightjacket

Want to move the hero image to the right side? You can't.

Want to create a pricing table with 4 tiers? Good luck.

Want to add a video background? Not supported.

Durable's editor lets you:
- Change text
- Swap images
- Add/remove predefined sections
- Change colors (from preset palettes)

That's it. No layout changes. No custom sections. No code injection. No creative freedom.

If the AI-generated layout doesn't match your vision, your options are "accept it" or "use a different builder."

### 3. The AI Content is Aggressively Generic

Here's actual copy Durable generated for my hypothetical bakery:

> "We are passionate about baking. Our team uses the finest ingredients to create delicious pastries and breads. Visit us today to experience our commitment to quality."

That says nothing. It could apply to any bakery in any city. It's the written equivalent of elevator music.

Every site I generated had the same problem. The content fills space but doesn't persuade, differentiate, or connect.

Plan to rewrite everything if you want your site to actually convert visitors.

### 4. Pricing Doesn't Match the Value

| Plan | Monthly | What You Get |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Starter | $12 | 1 site, 50 AI images, 100 contacts, 10 invoices |
| Business | $25 | 1 site, 500 AI images, 100 contacts, 100 invoices |
| Mogul | $80 | 5 sites, unlimited everything |

Let me be direct: $12/month for a website with no customization is expensive.

10Web charges $10/month for WordPress hosting with full design freedom. Hostinger charges $3/month for AI website + hosting. Framer's free plan offers more creative control than Durable's paid plans.

You're paying for speed, not features. If speed is your only priority, Durable might be worth it. If you care about anything else, there are better values.

### 5. No Code Export = Permanent Lock-In

Durable doesn't let you export your site. You can't download HTML, CSS, or any code. You're locked into their platform forever.

If Durable raises prices, you pay or rebuild from scratch. If they shut down, your site disappears. If you want to migrate to WordPress later, start over.

This isn't unique to Durable (Wix and Squarespace do the same), but it's worth understanding before you commit.

## Who Should Use Durable

Use Durable if:

- **You need a website TODAY.** Not tomorrow, not next week, today.
- **You're completely non-technical.** If "drag and drop" sounds intimidating.
- **You want business tools included.** CRM + invoicing + website in one place.
- **You don't care about unique design.** Generic is fine.
- **You have a Google Business Profile.** Speed + existing data = fastest path to live.

## Who Should Avoid Durable

Skip Durable if:

- **You want a unique, memorable website.** This isn't possible with Durable.
- **You need design flexibility.** You're locked into their layouts.
- **You care about long-term value.** Cheaper options exist with more features.
- **You might want to migrate later.** No export means starting over.
- **You're building for clients.** They'll notice their site looks like 100 others.

## How It Compares

| Builder | Speed | Customization | Price | My Rating |
|---------|-------|---------------|-------|-----------|
| **Durable** | ⚡⚡⚡ | ⭐ | $12-80/mo | 6.5/10 |
| 10Web | ⚡⚡ | ⚡⚡⚡ | $10-23/mo | 8.5/10 |
| Framer | ⚡⚡ | ⚡⚡⚡⚡ | $10-100/mo | 8/10 |
| Wix AI | ⚡ | ⚡⚡⚡ | $17-159/mo | 7/10 |
| Hostinger | ⚡⚡ | ⚡⚡ | $3-12/mo | 7/10 |

Durable wins on speed. Loses on everything else.

## Real Pricing (What You'll Actually Pay)

The advertised prices are accurate, but here's what they don't tell you:

**Starter Plan ($12/month):**
- 10 invoices/month is useless for any active business
- 100 contacts fills up fast
- 50 AI images sounds like a lot until you need 3 variants of each photo

**Business Plan ($25/month):**
- 100 invoices still limiting
- Still only 1 website
- Better image allowance

**Mogul Plan ($80/month):**
- 5 websites
- Unlimited everything
- But $80/month for AI-generated templates?

**Hidden costs:**
- Domain: Included free for 1 year
- Email: Not included (add $6/month for Google Workspace)
- Custom email: Requires external provider

The 7-day free trial is real. Use it. Build something. See if the limitations bother you.

## My Honest Recommendation

After 5 sites and 4 hours, here's my take:

**Durable is the fastest website builder for people who don't care about design.**

If you're a plumber who just needs something—anything—online, and you need it right now, Durable delivers. You'll have a functional website before you finish your coffee.

But if you want a website that:
- Looks unique
- Matches your brand
- Can grow with your business
- Gives you creative control

Durable is the wrong choice.

I wouldn't use Durable for client work. The limitations are too severe, and clients eventually notice when their site looks identical to their competitor's.

I might use Durable for a quick test landing page. Or a temporary site while building something better. Or for my aunt's quilt shop where "works" matters more than "works beautifully."

**For everyone else:** Spend the extra 2 minutes and use 10Web, Framer, or even Hostinger. The 30 seconds you save with Durable will cost you hours of frustration later.
