Balance image quality with loading speed - fast loading improves user experience and SEO rankings."

          <p class="text-sm mb-3">Full-res photos from camera are 20-50MB each. Uncompressed galleries load painfully slow. Compress to 300KB-1MB per image for web display. Keep original files for client delivery, display compressed versions on website. Tools: TinyPNG, ImageOptim, Squoosh. 90% file size reduction with minimal quality loss. Google penalizes slow sites in rankings—fast loading equals better SEO. Visitors abandon sites taking 3+ seconds to load.</p>

          <p class="text-sm mb-3">Only load images when viewer scrolls to them. 50-image gallery loads first 10 immediately, rest load as needed. Reduces initial page load by 80%. Most builders (Squarespace, Framer, Webflow) enable lazy loading by default. Verify it's enabled—check page speed insights. Lazy loading transforms 50-photo gallery from 15-second load to 3-second load. User experience matters: fast galleries feel professional, slow galleries feel amateur.</p>

Test your site on phone—frustrating mobile experience loses clients. Squarespace, Framer both excel at mobile galleries. Webflow requires careful testing. Mobile optimization isn't optional—it's primary. Your future clients are engaged couples scrolling through photographer portfolios at 11pm on Tuesday. Make their experience effortless.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">"List starting prices on your website. 'Wedding coverage from $3,000' eliminates tire-kickers. Clients who can't afford your rates self-select out. You stop responding to 50 inquiries that never convert. Pricing transparency respects everyone's time—yours and theirs. Photographers afraid to show prices fear losing leads. Reality: you're losing time fielding unqualified inquiries. Qualified clients appreciate transparency—they know budget fit before reaching out. Top photographers publicly list pricing: $5K-50K wedding packages don't scare away ideal clients, they filter for serious ones.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">"Offer 3 packages: Basic, Popular, Premium. $2K/$4K/$6K structure anchors middle option as reasonable value. Most clients choose middle package—you designed it to be best value. Psychology: choice overload paralyzes, 3 options simplifies decision. Avoid hourly pricing—clients can't budget. Package pricing sets clear expectations. '8 hours coverage, 400 edited photos, online gallery, print rights' = concrete deliverables. Ambiguous pricing creates anxiety—clear pricing creates confidence.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">"List deliverables clearly: '10 hours coverage, second photographer, 600+ edited photos, online gallery, print rights, engagement session.' Clients compare based on value, not price alone. $5K with 10 hours and second shooter = better value than $4K with 6 hours solo. Break down what they get: hours of coverage, number of edited photos, delivery timeline, print rights, album options. Ambiguous packages raise questions—clear answers eliminate objections. Smart photographers make packages incomparable: include different features so clients choose based on needs, not price.</p>
          <div class="text-xs font-black bg-violet-100 p-2">FOCUS: Value comparison beats price shopping</div>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-black mb-3 text-violet-900">PAYMENT PLANS INCREASE BOOKINGS</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">"Offer payment plans: '50% deposit, remainder due 30 days before event' or '3 monthly payments.' Removes sticker shock barrier. Client sees $5K total but pays $2.5K now, $2.5K later—palatable. Payment plans don't affect your cash flow negatively: deposit covers your time, final payment before event covers delivery. High-end photographers offer payment plans as standard—not desperation move, client service. Clients who hesitate at $5K upfront often commit to $2.5K deposit. Payment plans increase booking rates by 30%+ for many photographers.</p>
          <div class="text-xs font-black bg-violet-100 p-2">STRATEGY: 50% deposit, balance before event = win-win</div>

          <p class="text-sm mb-3">"Wedding and portrait clients often select specific photos for album or prints. Proofing workflow: client marks favorites, you see selections, edit only those. Albums and albums are expensive—proofing prevents wasting money editing unwanted photos. Platforms with proofing: ShootProof (specialized), Pixieset, Pixpa. Webflow can be customized for proofing. Proofing saves 10+ hours per wedding: edit 100 album photos instead of 600 full set. Professional photographers swear by proofing—amateurs edit everything, waste time, deliver slower.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">"Clients search 'wedding photographer Austin' not 'wedding photographer.' Include location throughout your site: page titles, meta descriptions, gallery names, footer. 'Austin Wedding Photographer' as homepage title. 'Portrait Photography in Austin, TX' in meta description. Name galleries with locations: 'Downtown Austin Engagement Session' not 'Engagement Session 1.' Google Maps business listing connects to your website—critical for local SEO. Local photography is hyper-competitive: 50-200 photographers per city. Local SEO determines who gets found first.</p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-black mb-3 text-indigo-900">IMAGE ALT TEXT = SEO GOLD</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">"Google can't 'see' images—reads alt text to understand content. Describe every photo: 'couple exchanging rings at sunset outdoor Austin wedding' not 'IMG_4523.jpg.' Alt text with keywords helps Google Images rank your photos. Clients browse Google Images for photographer style—proper alt text gets your photos discovered. Every gallery photo should have descriptive alt text: location, subject, mood. Time-consuming? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely. Top-ranking photographers have optimized alt text on every image.</p>
          <div class="text-xs font-black bg-indigo-100 p-2">SEO FACTOR: Alt text describes image + includes keywords</div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">"Publish blog posts: 'Real Wedding: Sarah & Mike at Laguna Gloria, Austin' ranks for venue + photographer searches. 'Austin Engagement Session Ideas' ranks for couples planning engagements. 'How to Choose a Wedding Photographer' captures clients in research phase. Blog posts build backlinks—other sites link to useful content. Each blog post = entry point for Google search. Portfolio alone has limited SEO potential—blog expands keyword reach. Top photographers blog weekly, rank for dozens of location + venue searches.</p>
          <div class="text-xs font-black bg-indigo-100 p-2">STRATEGY: Blog weekly with location-specific content</div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">"Google penalizes slow sites. Photography sites naturally slow due to images—optimize aggressively. Compressed images, lazy loading, minimal scripts, fast hosting. Test with Google PageSpeed Insights—aim for 70+ mobile score. Fast-loading sites rank higher, convert better. If your site takes 8 seconds to load, Google demotes you, users abandon. Optimization isn't optional—speed is ranking factor. 3-second load or faster for mobile. Fast hosting costs more (Webflow vs cheap shared) but pays for itself in rankings.</p>

        <div class="text-sm font-bold bg-white/20 p-4">HONEST ADVICE: Most photographers overbuild websites. Launch simple portfolio with 10-15 best photos, contact form, pricing page. Get clients, refine based on feedback. Your photos are your product—website just showcases them. No amount of website design makes bad photos look good. Great photos shine on any platform. Focus on shooting amazing work, building portfolio, getting client testimonials. Website is presentation layer, not product. Launch with Squarespace or Framer, focus on photography, upgrade platform when client volume justifies automation investment.</div>

            <li>• <strong>Show your best 12-24 images only:</strong> Quality over quantity. Curate ruthlessly.</li>

            <li>• <strong>Categorize by specialty:</strong> Weddings, portraits, commercial, fine art. Don't mix.</li>
            <li>• <strong>Tell stories with images:</strong> Series of 3-5 images from same shoot shows consistency.</li>

          Brutal truth: Your portfolio quality determines your booking rate. Invest in presentation that matches your photography quality.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
          <strong>Established photographers (steady bookings):</strong> Framer or Squarespace for premium presentation. Your photography is premium, your website should be too. One extra booking per year pays for platform 10x over.<br/>
          <strong>New photographers (building portfolio):</strong> Durable for fastest 30-second launch. Build portfolio, get first bookings, prove quality, upgrade to Framer/Squarespace when revenue justifies.<br/>
          <strong>Wedding photographers:</strong> Squarespace built for you. Client proofing galleries, password-protected, wedding-optimized templates. Framer if premium design priority.<br/>
          <strong>Commercial photographers:</strong> Framer or Webflow for complete control over portfolio presentation. Design quality drives commercial rates. Show professionalism that matches commercial client budgets.<br/>
          <strong>Remember:</strong> Clients hire photographers based on portfolio quality seen online. Your website is your salesperson, showcasing your work 24/7. Mobile visitors (70-80%) can't hire you if portfolio doesn't load or looks amateur. Fast loading, premium design, mobile-first = more bookings.
