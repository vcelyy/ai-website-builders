Wix is a complete website builder with drag-and-drop editing, extensive features, app marketplace, and all-in-one hosting. Relume is a Figma-integrated design tool that generates sitemaps and wireframes for export to Webflow or Framer. Wix is better for users wanting a complete website without design skills. Relume is better for designers using Figma and Webflow who want AI-assisted sitemap generation and wireframe components. These are not direct competitors - they serve different stages of the website creation process. Wix handles everything from design to hosting. Relume handles design planning for professional workflows. Choose Wix for complete websites. Choose Relume if you're a designer wanting AI assistance within Figma/Webflow workflow."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Wix and Relume have similar pricing at the entry level but serve different purposes. Wix starts at $17/month for basic plans, $29/month for premium features, up to $159/month for enterprise. Over 3 years, Wix costs $612-5724 depending on plan level. Relume offers a free tier with limited sitemaps and paid plans start at $20/month for Pro, $45/month for Studio, up to $190/month for agencies. Over 3 years, Relume costs $720-6840 depending on plan level. However, they're not directly comparable - Wix is a complete website solution with hosting. Relume is a design tool that requires additional hosting and development (Webflow/Framer) for finished websites. Total cost using Relume includes Relume + Webflow/Framer + hosting. For complete websites, Wix includes everything in one price. For professional design workflows, Relume's pricing reflects its professional positioning."

          "text": "Relume and Wix work completely differently. Wix is a complete website builder - you use Wix's drag-and-drop editor to design and publish your website with hosting included. It's an all-in-one solution for creating finished websites. Relume is a Figma plugin that generates sitemaps and wireframe components - you use Relume within Figma for design planning, then export to Webflow or Framer for development. Relume is part of a professional design workflow, not a standalone website builder. Wix requires no design tools or technical skills. Relume requires Figma knowledge and design experience. Wix outputs complete hosted websites. Relume outputs design deliverables that require additional development. Choose Wix if you want a complete website without design complexity. Choose Relume if you're a designer wanting AI assistance within professional Figma/Webflow workflow."

          "text": "Wix has built-in ecommerce with Wix Stores - product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing, inventory management. It's a complete ecommerce solution. You can start selling immediately with Wix's native ecommerce features. Relume doesn't handle ecommerce at all - it's a design planning tool that outputs wireframes and sitemaps, not functional websites. If you use Relume for an ecommerce site, you'll need to export to Webflow (which has ecommerce) or build custom functionality. For ecommerce sites, Wix is the practical choice - everything is built-in. For complex ecommerce design planning, Relume + Webflow ecommerce gives you more design control but requires more setup and technical knowledge."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Neither requires coding, but they serve different purposes. Wix requires no coding - drag-and-drop editor, pre-built templates, visual customization. Anyone can build a complete website without technical knowledge. Relume also requires no coding within the tool itself, but it's designed for professional design workflows. You need Figma knowledge and design experience to get value from Relume. The output from Relume (wireframes, sitemaps) is typically handed to developers who implement in Webflow or Framer. If you're a non-technical user wanting a website, Wix is the clear choice. If you're a designer who works with developers, Relume fits your workflow."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Wix doesn't allow code export - your website is locked to Wix's platform. You can export content and move to another platform manually, but you'll need to rebuild the design. This vendor lock-in is the trade-off for Wix's all-in-one convenience. Relume is designed FOR export - that's its entire purpose. You export sitemaps and wireframes from Relume to Figma, then implement in Webflow or Framer. The final website lives on Webflow or Framer, not Relume. With Relume, you own the design deliverables. With Wix, you're tied to their hosting and platform. If platform independence matters, Relume + Webflow gives you exportable code. If convenience matters more, Wix's vendor lock-in is the price you pay."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Relume requires Figma - it's a Figma plugin. You must have Figma installed and be comfortable working in it. If you don't use Figma, Relume won't work for you. Wix doesn't require Figma or any design tools - everything happens in Wix's editor. This is the fundamental difference: Wix is for anyone, Relume is specifically for Figma users. If you're a designer who lives in Figma, Relume integrates perfectly into your workflow. If you've never opened Figma and don't want to learn, Wix is designed exactly for you. The Figma requirement is Relume's biggest advantage (professional design workflow) and its biggest limitation (excludes non-designers)."

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Important: Not Direct Competitors</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Wix and Relume serve completely different purposes and are not direct competitors. Wix is a complete website builder for creating finished websites. Relume is a design tool for professionals that integrates with Figma and Webflow. Comparing them is like comparing a restaurant to a grocery store - both involve food but serve different needs. Choose based on whether you want a complete website (Wix) or design workflow assistance (Relume).

        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A freelance designer needed a portfolio site for her UX agency. Had to show 24 case studies with detailed process documentation. Client wanted to approve structure before building anything.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The Wix route:</strong> She started building directly in Wix. Added pages, sections, case studies. After 2 weeks, client said: "This structure doesn't work for our needs. Can you reorganize everything?" She spent another week rearranging. Total: 3 weeks of frustration.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Next project, she used Relume:</strong> Opened Relume in Figma. Generated sitemap with AI. Client reviewed wireframes, requested changes. Made iterations in 30 minutes. Client approved. Exported to Webflow, built entire site in 3 hours. Total: 4 hours from planning to launch.</p>

          <div class="bg-amber-100 border-l-[4px] border-amber-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-amber-900 font-medium"><strong>The brutal truth:</strong> Wix is faster for building. Relume is faster for planning. But when you're working with clients, planning IS building. Every hour spent planning saves 10 hours of revisions.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-yellow-100 border-l-[4px] border-yellow-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-yellow-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> If you're building your own site and you know what you want, Wix is perfect - just start building. But if you're building for clients, or if your site has complex information architecture (20+ pages, multiple content types), spend 2 hours in Relume first. It'll save you 2 weeks of pain.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The framework:</strong> Wix for simple sites where structure is obvious. Relume + Webflow for complex sites where structure needs planning and client approval.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Is Relume or Wix better for website building?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-indigo-600">It's a tie at 8.2/10</strong> - but that score is misleading because they serve completely different purposes. Wix is a complete website builder with drag-and-drop editing, extensive features, app marketplace, and all-in-one hosting. Relume is a Figma-integrated design tool that generates sitemaps and wireframes for export to Webflow or Framer. Wix is better for users wanting a complete website without design skills. Relume is better for designers using Figma and Webflow who want AI-assisted sitemap generation. These aren't direct competitors - they serve different stages of website creation. Wix handles everything from design to hosting. Relume handles design planning for professional workflows.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">What is the price difference between Relume and Wix?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-indigo-600">Similar entry pricing, different value propositions.</strong> Wix starts at $17/month for basic plans, $29/month for premium features, up to $159/month for enterprise. Over 3 years, that's $612-5,724. Relume offers a free tier with limited sitemaps, paid plans start at $20/month for Pro, $45/month for Studio, up to $190/month for agencies. Over 3 years, that's $720-6,840. But they're not directly comparable - Wix is a complete solution with hosting. Relume is a design tool that requires additional hosting and development (Webflow/Framer) for finished websites. The total cost using Relume includes Relume + Webflow/Framer + hosting. For complete websites, Wix includes everything. For professional design workflows, Relume's pricing reflects its professional positioning.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">How do Relume and Wix work differently?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-indigo-600">Completely different workflows.</strong> Wix is a complete website builder - you use Wix's drag-and-drop editor to design and publish your website with hosting included. It's an all-in-one solution for creating finished websites. Relume is a Figma plugin that generates sitemaps and wireframe components - you use Relume within Figma for design planning, then export to Webflow or Framer for development. Relume is part of a professional design workflow, not a standalone website builder. Wix requires no design tools or technical skills. Relume requires Figma knowledge and design experience. Wix outputs complete hosted websites. Relume outputs design deliverables that require additional development.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can Relume or Wix handle ecommerce?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-indigo-600">Wix has built-in ecommerce, Relume doesn't.</strong> Wix Stores includes product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing, inventory management - complete ecommerce solution. You can start selling immediately. Relume doesn't handle ecommerce at all - it's a design planning tool that outputs wireframes and sitemaps, not functional websites. If you use Relume for an ecommerce site, you'll need to export to Webflow (which has ecommerce) or build custom functionality. For ecommerce sites, Wix is the practical choice - everything is built-in. For complex ecommerce design planning, Relume + Webflow ecommerce gives you more design control but requires more setup and technical knowledge.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do I need coding skills for Relume or Wix?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-indigo-600">Neither requires coding, but different skill sets.</strong> Wix requires no coding - drag-and-drop editor, pre-built templates, visual customization. Anyone can build a complete website without technical knowledge. Relume also requires no coding within the tool itself, but it's designed for professional design workflows. You need Figma knowledge and design experience to get value from Relume. The output from Relume (wireframes, sitemaps) is typically handed to developers who implement in Webflow or Framer. If you're a non-technical user wanting a website, Wix is the clear choice. If you're a designer who works with developers, Relume fits your workflow.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-indigo-600">Wix locks you in, Relume is built for export.</strong> Wix doesn't allow code export - your website is locked to Wix's platform. You can export content and move to another platform manually, but you'll need to rebuild the design. This vendor lock-in is the trade-off for Wix's all-in-one convenience. Relume is designed FOR export - that's its entire purpose. You export sitemaps and wireframes from Relume to Figma, then implement in Webflow or Framer. The final website lives on Webflow or Framer, not Relume. With Relume, you own the design deliverables. With Wix, you're tied to their hosting and platform. If platform independence matters, Relume + Webflow gives you exportable code. If convenience matters more, Wix's vendor lock-in is the price you pay.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do I need Figma for Relume or Wix?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong class="text-indigo-600">Relume requires Figma, Wix doesn't.</strong> Relume is a Figma plugin - you must have Figma installed and be comfortable working in it. If you don't use Figma, Relume won't work for you at all. Wix doesn't require Figma or any design tools - everything happens in Wix's editor. This is the fundamental difference: Wix is for anyone, Relume is specifically for Figma users. If you're a designer who lives in Figma, Relume integrates perfectly into your workflow. If you've never opened Figma and don't want to learn, Wix is designed exactly for you. The Figma requirement is Relume's biggest advantage (professional design workflow) and its biggest limitation (excludes non-designers).
