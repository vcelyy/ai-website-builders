Website: outdated design from 2018, inventory last updated 4 months ago, "call for pricing" on every vehicle, 5 blurry photos per car, contact form didn't work, site loaded in 8 seconds, not mobile-responsive. Google ranking: page 7 for "used cars Phoenix." Monthly metrics: 180 website visitors, 8 test drive requests, 12 vehicle sales (avg $24,000) = $288,000 revenue.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Month 1 changes: (1) Rebuilt site in Webflow with AI-generated dealership template featuring massive "47 Vehicles in Stock" counter with pulsing animation. (2) Implemented live inventory CMS with vehicle photos, pricing, mileage, Carfax links, auto-updated daily from dealer management system. (3) Added 360° exterior and interior photo galleries for featured vehicles (15 photos per car). (4) Online finance pre-approval form with instant credit decision integration. (5) Mobile-first responsive design with one-touch test drive scheduling. (6) Google Business optimization: 200+ photos, updated hours, respond to all reviews. (7) Added vehicle comparison tool. (8) Live chat for instant questions. (9) "No hidden fees" pricing transparency badges. (10) Speed optimization: 8 seconds → 1.8 second load time. Investment: $42/month Webflow, $800 photography setup, $29/month live chat. Owner skeptical: "Last website wasted money."</p>

      <h2 class="text-4xl sm:text-5xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-10">Dealership Website FAQ</h2>

      <div class="space-y-4">
        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">How often should I update my vehicle inventory?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Daily. Buyers see vehicles from 3 days ago as "sold, move on." Live inventory with "X vehicles in stock" counter = reason to visit. Premier Auto Mall: updated daily, 4x more lot visits. Connect website to dealer management system for automatic inventory updates. Real-time inventory = active dealership = buyer visits = vehicles sold.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">Should I display vehicle pricing or hide it?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Display it transparently. "Call for pricing" = sketchy = they call competitor. Visible pricing with "no hidden fees" badge = trust = qualified leads. Dealership added transparent pricing: 67% more qualified inquiries. Price transparency = can afford = serious buyer = higher conversion. Hide pricing = lose 67% of leads to competitors with transparent pricing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">How many vehicle photos should I display?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">15-20 photos per vehicle with 360° exterior and interior views. Dark, blurry, 3 photos = "what's wrong with it?" = skip. Professional photo galleries = confidence = test drive. Premier Auto Mall: added 360° galleries, test drive requests +53%. Photos = digital showroom = must look quality. Budget $500-1500 for professional automotive photography. Mobile users: 83% click photos first.</p>
        </div>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">Is mobile optimization important for dealership websites?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Critical - 79% of car buyers search on mobile phones. Site sucks on phone = they call competitor. Mobile-responsive inventory with one-click test drive scheduling = they visit your lot. Car shopping = mobile search. Premier Auto Mall: mobile-first design, 76% traffic from mobile, 3x more test drives scheduled. If your site doesn't work perfectly on phone, you lose 79% of potential buyers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">Should I offer online finance pre-approval?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes. Online finance pre-approval = ready to buy = faster closing. Buyers pre-approved = serious = higher conversion. Premier Auto Mall: 43% faster sales, 67% of online applicants purchased within 48 hours. No online finance = they get pre-approved elsewhere = buy from competitor with that pre-approval. Finance app = time-saver for both parties = close faster = more sales.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">How do I rank higher in Google for local searches?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Claim and optimize Google Business profile: add 200+ photos, update hours, respond to all reviews, post inventory updates. Premier Auto Mall: claimed profile, 3x more discovery visits. Google Business = free local SEO = show up in "car dealership near me" searches. Unclaimed = invisible. Claim it = photos = reviews = updates = page 1 = more visits.</p>

        <p class="text-white text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">Your dealership website is your digital showroom - open 24/7, selling while you sleep. If it's outdated with stale inventory, hidden pricing, poor photos, difficult contact, you lose 79% of buyers to competitors with modern sites.</p>

        <p class="text-white text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">Webflow AI is the winner for large dealerships needing custom inventory management. Squarespace AI for mid-size dealerships prioritizing professional appearance and buyer trust. Wix AI for small dealerships needing quick setup with automotive templates.</p>

        <p class="text-yellow-300 font-black text-2xl">Build live inventory. Show transparent pricing. Display professional photos. Optimize for mobile. Offer online finance. Claim your Google Business profile. This is how dealerships sell more cars.</p>
