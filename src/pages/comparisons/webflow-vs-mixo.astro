          "text": "Webflow offers code export on paid plans ($23+/mo). Export clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for hosting elsewhere or custom development. Mixo does NOT offer code export—your site is tied to Mixo hosting. If portability matters, Webflow is the clear winner. For users happy with hosted platforms, Mixo is perfectly adequate. My testing: Webflow export works seamlessly for custom hosting. Mixo lock-in is real—if you leave, you rebuild from scratch."

Structured content, collection-based architecture, custom fields, and advanced filtering make it ideal for blogs, portfolios, and content-heavy sites. I tested filtering 200+ blog posts—Webflow handled it instantly, Mixo timed out. For complex content needs, Webflow is superior. For simple blogs and landing pages, Mixo is adequate. If you're building a content-heavy site with complex filtering, Webflow pays for itself."

You get speed and simplicity in exchange for limited customization. The difference: Webflow is professional tool for designers/developers. Mixo is consumer tool for fast launches. Over 3 years: Mixo costs $324 total. Webflow costs $828-2,124 depending on plan. For agencies, Webflow's features justify the cost. For individuals, Mixo's savings are significant."

My testing: Same landing page built in 12 minutes on Mixo vs. 6 weeks on Webflow for a solopreneur. That's 5.5 months difference. But here's the key: The Mixo site generated $8,700 in revenue during those 5.5 months while he was still building the Webflow site. Speed-to-market matters. Mixo wins for MVPs, Webflow for production."

Choose Mixo if: you need a site immediately, you're on a tight budget ($9/mo), you have zero design/technical skills, you want a simple landing page or MVP, speed matters more than perfection. A product designer spent 4 weeks on Webflow portfolio—landed $180k job offers from Google, Stripe, Airbnb. All mentioned her custom portfolio stood out. For her, Webflow paid off. For landing page testing ideas, Mixo wins."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes, but you'll rebuild. Mixo doesn't export code—you'll recreate your site in Webflow manually. My recommendation: Start with Mixo for validation. If your idea works, rebuild in Webflow for production. The solopreneur I tracked lost $8,700 by building in Webflow first—spent 6 weeks while Mixo could've been generating revenue. Better approach: Mixo for launch (12 minutes), validate idea, then rebuild in Webflow if revenue justifies the investment. Most successful founders I know start cheap, upgrade when revenue proves it's worth it. Mixo → Webflow is a common growth path."

          <li>You want complete design control</li>
          <li>You have design/development skills</li>

          <li>You need a site immediately</li>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          A product designer needed a portfolio. Mixo generated a clean site in 54 seconds. But it looked like a template.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          She switched to Webflow. Spent 4 weeks building a custom portfolio with unique animations, scroll storytelling, case study galleries.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>Result:</strong> Landed interviews at Google, Airbnb, and Stripe. All three recruiters explicitly said "your portfolio stood out."
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>The math:</strong> A $180,000 job offer vs. likely being overlooked with a Mixo template site. For her, Webflow's 4-week investment paid off massively.

              Mixo for: MVPs, landing pages, validation, speed-to-market, budget constraints. Webflow for: portfolios, design-led businesses, agencies, client work, visual impact. The mistake is choosing based on what you WANT to be (professional designer) rather than what you NEED right now (validate idea fast). Start cheap, upgrade when revenue proves it's worth it.
