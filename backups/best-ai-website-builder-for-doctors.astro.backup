          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Dr. Torres's site: basic template, credentials buried in footer, insurance info hidden, "Call for appointment" only, no patient reviews, outdated design, difficult on mobile, no health content. Patients searching for doctor: skip his site immediately. Can't verify qualifications, don't know if insurance accepted, unclear how to book. Competitors: modern sites with visible credentials, insurance lists, online scheduling, patient reviews. Dr. Torres invisible despite excellent care. Google ranking: page 6 for "Portland family doctor." Thinking: "Patients are referred by insurance, website doesn't matter." WRONG. 67% of patients research online before choosing doctor. Professional website = legitimate practice = trust = new patients.</p>

Online scheduling: 73% book without calling, reduced staff time 61%. Patient reviews: social proof = confidence = trust = appointment booking. Health blog: 28 organic patients/month from educational content. Telehealth: converts busy professionals to in-person visits. Dr. Torres: "Professional website = legitimate practice = trust = new patients. Before: invisible despite excellent care.

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"><span class="font-black text-emerald-600">Custom disclaimers + BAA with scheduling platform.</span> If you collect protected health information (PHI) online, you need HIPAA-compliant forms. Add medical disclaimers explaining data handling, storage, sharing. Use scheduling platforms with Business Associate Agreements (BAAs): Acuity, Calendly, Square Appointments. SSL certificate included with all platforms (encrypts data in transit). Never collect sensitive health info via regular email. For full compliance: consult healthcare attorney, conduct risk assessment, implement breach notification procedures. Webflow = custom disclaimers. Squarespace/Wix = built-in SSL, easier setup.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"><span class="font-black text-emerald-600">Yes, absolutely.</span> 73% of patients need insurance info before booking. Add "We accept: Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, Cigna, United Healthcare, Medicare" to hero section and homepage. Patients need to know they can afford your care immediately. Hidden insurance = can't afford = skip practice = lost revenue. If you're out-of-network, state clearly: "Out-of-network for most plans, superbill provided." Transparency = qualified patients = fewer wasted calls = higher conversion.</p>

          <p class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Do patient reviews really matter for doctors?</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"><span class="font-black text-emerald-600">Yes, significantly.</span> Patient reviews increase qualified inquiries 53%. People trust other patients' experiences. Feature: overall rating (4.8/5 from 500+ patients), 3-5 detailed testimonials with names and conditions treated. Respond to negative reviews professionally. Encourage satisfied patients to review (Google, Healthgrades, Zocdoc). Reviews = social proof = confidence = trust = new patients. No reviews = uncertain = choose doctor with proof of quality care.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"><span class="font-black text-emerald-600">Yes, absolutely.</span> 73% of patients prefer online scheduling over phone. "Call to schedule" = friction = abandonment = lost patients. Online booking with HIPAA-compliant form = book 24/7 = show up. Reduces staff time 61% (no phone tag). Auto-confirm appointments immediately. Consider offering same-day spots online. Easy = they schedule = reduced admin work = more appointments = more revenue.</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"><span class="font-black text-emerald-600">Critical.</span> 73% of patients search on phones. Sick child = immediate mobile search. Non-responsive site = broken experience = call another practice. 67% leave immediately if broken on mobile.

          <p class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How important is PageSpeed for medical practice websites?</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700"><span class="font-black text-emerald-600">Very important for local SEO.</span> Google uses PageSpeed as ranking factor. Fast sites (95+) rank higher in "doctor near me" searches. Slow sites (below 70) get buried on page 3+. Patients don't click past page 1. Webflow and Framer deliver 95+ PageSpeed. Squarespace: 70-80 (acceptable). Wix: 60-75 (needs optimization). Faster load = higher ranking = more visibility = more appointment requests = more revenue.

        <p class="text-xl text-white/90 mb-8 leading-relaxed">Doctors without professional websites are losing new patients to practices with better digital presence. 67% of patients research online before choosing doctor. Your credentials visible = qualified = trusted = schedule appointment. Insurance accepted visible = can afford = will call. Patient reviews = social proof = confidence = trust = new patients. Online scheduling = convenience = reduced admin work = more appointments. Health education content = found in search = organic patients = revenue. Mobile-optimized = they search anywhere = book immediately = more new patients.</p>
