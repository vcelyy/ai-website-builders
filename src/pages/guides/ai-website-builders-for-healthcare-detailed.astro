          "text": "Most AI website builders (Squarespace, Wix, Framer, Mixo, Webflow) are NOT HIPAA-compliant out of the box. Their standard forms and hosting do not meet HIPAA requirements for protected health information (PHI). To maintain HIPAA compliance: Never collect PHI through standard builder forms, use HIPAA-compliant form solutions like JotForm Healthcare or FormDr, use secure patient portals for clinical communication, avoid storing patient data on builder platforms, include proper privacy policies and disclaimers, ensure business associate agreements with any vendors handling PHI, and consult legal counsel for compliance requirements. Many healthcare providers use AI builders successfully by keeping PHI collection separate from their website - using the site for information and booking only, with clinical communication through HIPAA-compliant systems."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "For appointment booking, healthcare providers have three main approaches. (1) Integrated booking - Wix Bookings, Squarespace Acuity integration, or Calendly embeds allow patients to book directly. Convenient but requires HIPAA-compliant setup - avoid collecting medical information through booking forms, only collect name, contact, appointment type/purpose. (2) Request system - simple form collects contact info and preferred times, staff follows up to schedule. Safer HIPAA-wise since no medical details collected online. (3) Phone-based - list phone number prominently for appointment scheduling. Most traditional but HIPAA-safest. For therapists and counselors: Calendly or Acuity work well. For medical practices: integrated booking or request forms. For dentists and specialists: booking apps through Wix or Squarespace. Critical: never collect detailed medical information through website forms - that requires HIPAA-compliant systems."

          "text": "Several HIPAA-compliant solutions integrate with AI website builders. JotForm Healthcare offers HIPAA-compliant forms that embed on any website - collects patient information, medical history, and intake forms securely. FormDr specializes in healthcare forms with HIPAA compliance, embeds easily, and offers BAA coverage. PatientSimple provides complete patient intake and scheduling with HIPAA compliance. These tools embed seamlessly on Squarespace, Wix, Framer, or Webflow sites. Workflow: website provides information and booking, then embed secure HIPAA-compliant forms for patient intake, or link to external HIPAA-compliant patient portal. Many healthcare providers use this hybrid approach successfully - AI builder for marketing and information, specialized healthcare forms for data collection. Always verify BAA coverage and consult legal counsel."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Healthcare pricing transparency varies by specialty and practice model. For therapists and counselors: showing session rates ($150-250 per session) increases qualified inquiries by 40%. Patients self-select based on budget, saving everyone time. For medical practices: less common to show pricing due to insurance complexity. Better to show: insurance plans accepted, typical visit costs by insurance tier, payment policies, and financing options. For elective procedures (cosmetic dentistry, plastic surgery, med spa): show pricing ranges prominently since patients comparison shop. For cash-pay services (acupuncture, massage, coaching): show clear pricing. Best practice: indicate your pricing approach (insurance vs cash-pay), show accepted insurance plans, provide payment policy information, and include contact option for specific pricing questions. Transparency builds trust and reduces administrative burden."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Healthcare websites must include specific legal disclaimers: (1) Medical disclaimer - website content is for informational purposes only, not medical advice, (2) Emergency disclaimer - call 911 for medical emergencies, not the website or contact form, (3) No doctor-patient relationship disclaimer - website content doesn't create provider-patient relationship, (4) Privacy policy - how patient information is collected and used, (5) Terms of service - website use policies, (6) License information - provider credentials and license numbers, (7) Jurisdiction disclaimer - services offered in specific locations only if applicable, (8) Third-party content disclaimer - if linking to external resources. Best practice: place disclaimers prominently in footer, include on all contact forms, and consult healthcare attorney to ensure compliance with state and federal regulations. HIPAA adds additional requirements if collecting PHI - always consult legal counsel."

          <p class="text-gray-700">Most AI website builders (Squarespace, Wix, Framer, Mixo, Webflow) are NOT HIPAA-compliant out of the box. Their standard forms and hosting do not meet HIPAA requirements for protected health information (PHI). To maintain HIPAA compliance: Never collect PHI through standard builder forms, use HIPAA-compliant form solutions like JotForm Healthcare or FormDr, use secure patient portals for clinical communication, avoid storing patient data on builder platforms, include proper privacy policies and disclaimers, ensure business associate agreements with any vendors handling PHI, and consult legal counsel for compliance requirements.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What features should healthcare websites include?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Healthcare websites need provider profiles with photos, credentials, and specialties, clear service descriptions for conditions treated and procedures, appointment booking or request system via Calendly/Acuity or phone-based, insurance and payment information showing accepted plans, new patient information on what to expect and bring, location and access details with address and parking, patient resources like forms and educational content, emergency information with directive to call 911, professional disclaimers that content is not medical advice, contact information for non-emergency inquiries, telehealth information if offered, and mobile-optimized experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">How should healthcare providers handle appointment booking on websites?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">For appointment booking, healthcare providers have three main approaches. Integrated booking via Wix Bookings, Squarespace Acuity integration, or Calendly embeds allows patients to book directly. Convenient but requires HIPAA-compliant setup - avoid collecting medical information through booking forms, only collect name, contact, and appointment type. Request system using simple form collects contact info and preferred times then staff follows up. Safer HIPAA-wise since no medical details collected online. Phone-based listing phone number prominently is most traditional but HIPAA-safest. Critical: never collect detailed medical information through website forms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-r-lg">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What HIPAA-compliant alternatives work with AI website builders?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Several HIPAA-compliant solutions integrate with AI website builders. JotForm Healthcare offers HIPAA-compliant forms that embed on any website and collects patient information and medical history securely. FormDr specializes in healthcare forms with HIPAA compliance and embeds easily. PatientSimple provides complete patient intake and scheduling with HIPAA compliance. These tools embed seamlessly on Squarespace, Wix, Framer, or Webflow sites. Workflow: website provides information and booking, then embed secure HIPAA-compliant forms for patient intake or link to external HIPAA-compliant patient portal. Always verify BAA coverage and consult legal counsel.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Should healthcare providers show pricing on their websites?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Healthcare pricing transparency varies by specialty. For therapists and counselors: showing session rates ($150-250 per session) increases qualified inquiries by 40% as patients self-select based on budget. For medical practices: less common to show pricing due to insurance complexity. Better to show insurance plans accepted, typical visit costs by insurance tier, and payment policies. For elective procedures like cosmetic dentistry or plastic surgery: show pricing ranges prominently since patients comparison shop. For cash-pay services: show clear pricing. Best practice: indicate pricing approach, show accepted insurance plans, provide payment policy information, and include contact option for specific pricing questions.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">What legal disclaimers should healthcare websites include?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Healthcare websites must include specific legal disclaimers: medical disclaimer stating website content is for informational purposes only not medical advice, emergency disclaimer directing to call 911 for medical emergencies, no doctor-patient relationship disclaimer stating website content doesn't create provider-patient relationship, privacy policy explaining how patient information is collected and used, terms of service for website use policies, license information showing provider credentials and license numbers, and jurisdiction disclaimer if services offered in specific locations only. Best practice: place disclaimers prominently in footer, include on all contact forms, and consult healthcare attorney to ensure compliance with state and federal regulations.</p>
