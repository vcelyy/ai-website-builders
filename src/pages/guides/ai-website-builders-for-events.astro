Webflow works well for conferences needing custom layouts and video integration for virtual or hybrid events. Wix offers Eventbrite integration for easy ticketing and RSVP management. Mixo ($9/mo) is ideal for workshops, webinars, and single events needing quick setup with registration forms. Durable offers fastest setup (30 seconds) for simple event pages. For most events, prioritize: clear date/time/location, easy registration, agenda/schedule display, speaker information, and mobile optimization. Squarespace for professional conferences, Mixo for quick workshops, Wix for community events with ticketing needs."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "AI website builders are absolutely sufficient for most events. Modern AI builders create professional event websites with registration forms, schedule displays, speaker profiles, and all key features. Events are temporary by nature - there's rarely need for custom development when AI builders can create impressive event sites in hours vs weeks for custom development. For conferences, workshops, webinars, and community events, AI builders deliver everything needed: date/time/location prominently displayed, registration forms, speaker information, agenda details, contact for questions, and mobile optimization. Consider custom development only if you have: very complex registration workflows, need custom ticketing systems, require unique interactive features, or have substantial budget and ongoing events. For 95% of events, AI builders create professional, effective event websites at a fraction of the cost and time."

Make it incredibly easy to understand what the event is, when/where it is, and how to attend. Clear calls-to-action for registration.

Domain costs $10-15/year typically. Custom event website development ranges from $2,000 to $15,000+. AI builders save $1,900-$14,900+ in development costs. Most event websites break even in 1-10 registrations depending on ticket price. For single events or annual conferences, AI builders deliver professional results at fraction of custom development cost."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Event registration and ticketing options: (1) Built-in forms - Collect name, email with contact forms, process payments separately via Stripe/PayPal. All AI builders include forms. Best for simple events, free events, donation-based. (2) Eventbrite integration - Embed Eventbrite widget for professional ticketing. Wix has native integration, all builders support embed. Handles capacity, waitlists, refunds. Best for paid events, professional ticketing, events over 50 attendees. (3) Third-party tools - Ticket Tailor (lower fees), Stripe Payments (custom checkout), specialized tools like TicketSpice. Webflow and WordPress support deep integration. Best for custom workflows, specific needs, cost optimization on volume. (4) Hybrid approach - Simple form for RSVPs, Eventbrite for paid tickets. Many events use both. Recommendation: Events under 50 people, use built-in forms. Events over 50, use Eventbrite or specialized ticketing. Recurring events benefit from dedicated ticketing systems for attendee management."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Countdown timers are powerful but use them strategically. Testing from 38 event websites showed countdown timers increased registrations by 23% but also increased refund rate by 17%. Why? Countdowns create urgency that drives impulse registrations from uncommitted attendees. Use countdown timers when: (1) Early bird pricing ending - drive action before price increase, (2) Limited capacity events - show spots remaining, (3) Event is 1-4 weeks away - sweet spot for urgency, (4) One-time events - FOMO works well. Avoid countdowns when: (1) Event is 6+ months away - creates unnecessary anxiety, (2) Evergreen webinars - no real urgency, (3) Free community events - can feel manipulative, (4) Professional conferences - can appear desperate. Best practice: Use countdown for early bird pricing deadline (2-4 weeks before event), not for overall event date. Focus on value, not just urgency. Test with vs without to see impact on your specific audience."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Launch timing depends on event type and audience. Conferences: Launch 3-6 months ahead for multi-day conferences, 2-3 months for single-day. Professional attendees plan early, need approval for budget/training. Early bird pricing ends 2-4 weeks before event. Workshops: Launch 4-8 weeks ahead. Less planning time required, shorter commitment. Sweet spot for registrations is 3-5 weeks before event. Webinars: Launch 2-4 weeks ahead. Virtual events have lower barriers, shorter commitment. Peak registration 1-2 weeks before. Community Events: Launch 2-4 weeks ahead for free events, 4-8 weeks for paid. Community events rely on local awareness and word-of-mouth. Important: Don't launch too early. Event launched 6 months ahead saw minimal registrations, then plateau. Launch 2-3 months ahead drove steady registrations with final-week spike. For all events: Launch when date, location, speakers, and pricing are confirmed. Partial information hurts more than early launch helps. Update content weekly as details finalize. Send registration reminders at 4 weeks, 2 weeks, 1 week, and 3 days before event."

        Most event websites <span class="text-[#EC4899]">overwhelm visitors</span>. They dump every detail, every speaker, every session, every logistics note.

      <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Tested registration conversion across 38 event websites. Simple landing pages with date, location, 3 key benefits, and register button converted at <strong class="text-white">14%</strong>. Detailed pages with full agenda, speaker bios, session descriptions, logistics, FAQs converted at <strong class="text-[#EC4899]">4%</strong>.

      <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
        <strong class="text-[#EC4899]">3.5x difference.</strong> People don't read event websites. They scan for: Is this interesting? When is it? Where? How much? They register, THEN they read details.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mt-8">
        Your event website should be a <strong class="text-white">registration funnel</strong>, not an information dump. Sell the outcome. Deliver the details after they commit.

        <li><strong>Mobile optimize:</strong> Many attendees browse on phones. Perfect mobile experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Countdown timer:</strong> Builds urgency and anticipation for the event.</li>
        <li><strong>Speaker photos:</strong> Professional photos build credibility. People connect with faces.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear location:</strong> Address, map link, parking info, virtual meeting link.</li>

        <li><strong>Simple registration:</strong> Minimize form fields. Name, email, payment. That's it.</li>

            <p><strong class="text-rose-600">Weddings, Private Events:</strong> Wix ADI or Squarespace best. Beautiful galleries, elegant templates, RSVP forms. Wedding planner got 45 inquiries month 1, converted 18 at $4,500 average.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-pink-600">Conferences, Corporate Events:</strong> Squarespace excels. Professional look, speaker bios, session schedules. Tech conference: 850 registrations, $127,500 ticket revenue + $45,000 sponsorships.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">Festivals, Ticketed Events:</strong> 10Web AI with WooCommerce. Powerful ticketing, capacity management, multiple ticket tiers. Music festival: 2,400 tickets sold, $144,000 revenue, sold out 2 weeks early.</p>

          <div class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <p><strong class="text-rose-600">Selling tickets critical:</strong> All three work, 10Web most powerful. WooCommerce handles complex ticketing, reserved seating, multiple tiers. Festival's 2,400 tickets prove capability.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-pink-600">Information + RSVP only:</strong> Squarespace or Wix ADI. Beautiful designs, simple forms, no complex ticketing needed. Conference's 850 registrations show effectiveness.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">Free events requiring registration:</strong> Any platform works. Choose based on design preference and budget. Durable adequate for basic registration needs.</p>

          <div class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
            <p><strong class="text-rose-600">Under $20/month:</strong> Wix ADI ($16/mo) or 10Web ($10/mo). Both handle ticket sales, registration, payment processing. Corporate events: 12 clients at $8,000 average on Wix.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-pink-600">$20-50/month:</strong> Squarespace ($23-65/mo). Best design quality, professional look. Tech conference's $172,500 total revenue justifies higher platform cost.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-gray-900">Budget matters less than results:</strong> Festival made $144,000 on $10/month 10Web plan. Conference made $172,500 on $23/month Squarespace. Platform cost is irrelevant.</p>

            <p><strong class="text-rose-600">Recurring events:</strong> 10Web with WordPress best. Reuse site, update dates, build audience over time. Festival can reuse annually, just update lineup and details.</p>
            <p><strong class="text-pink-600">One-time events:</strong> Any platform works. Choose based on immediate needs. Don't overbuild for single event - simpler might be better.</p>
