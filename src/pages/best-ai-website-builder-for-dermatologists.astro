          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Dr. Emily Rodriguez, Austin dermatologist. 9 years practice. Specializes in acne, eczema, cosmetic dermatology. Basic site: logo, "About" page with bio, 8 small treatment photos total, no condition-specific info, buried services list, "Call for appointment" only, board certification hidden on page 4, no patient resources, difficult to navigate. Monthly appointments: 27. Quarterly revenue: $38,000. Google ranking: page 5 for "Austin dermatologist acne." Competitors with extensive galleries capturing all inquiries. Dr. Rodriguez thinking: "Patients are referred by primary care, website doesn't matter." WRONG. 67% of dermatology patients research online before choosing doctor. Her clinical skills excellent, invisible online.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Chose Squarespace for professional treatment galleries. Built: brutal hero with "Austin's Premier Acne & Eczema Specialist" messaging, treatment gallery organized by condition (500+ before/after photos), condition guides for each major concern (acne, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, melasma), visible board certification (ABD), online appointment scheduling with real-time availability, telehealth option prominently, skin care blog with treatment tips, patient resources section, new patient forms downloadable. Treatment galleries: consistent presentation, professional quality. Condition guides: what to expect, treatment options, recovery. Investment: $2,800 (design + 6 months hosting). Launch: 2 days.</p>

Google ranking: page 1 position 2 for "Austin dermatologist acne." Treatment gallery: patients spend 8.3 minutes viewing (vs 1:47 before), 79% book appointment after seeing results. Conditions treated visible: patients cite "she treats my condition" as #1 reason for booking. Online scheduling: 73% book without calling, reduced staff time 67%. Skin care blog: 34 organic patients/month from educational content. Telehealth option: converts busy professionals to in-person appointments. Dr. Rodriguez: "Professional gallery = expert dermatologist = trust = appointment booking. Before: invisible despite excellent skills. After: patients see results = trust my expertise = schedule."</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">100+ minimum, organized by condition. Patients want proof treatments work. 79% want to see results for their specific concern. Organize by: acne, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, melasma, cosmetic treatments. Show consistent before/afters: same lighting, same angles, realistic results. Include diverse patients: different skin types, ages, genders. Gallery = proven effectiveness = trust = schedule appointment. Investment in professional photography returns 10x through increased appointments. More photos = more proof = more trust = more bookings.</p>

          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I list conditions treated prominently?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Yes, everywhere. 67% of patients search by specific condition. Add "We Treat: Acne, Eczema, Psoriasis, Rosacea, Melasma, Anti-Aging" to hero section, homepage, services page. Patients need to know you treat their specific concern immediately. Buried conditions list = patients don't know you help them = skip. Visible conditions = you treat this = call you = schedule. Primary care referrals go online first. If they don't see their condition on your site, they find another dermatologist. Make it obvious.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Yes, significantly. Educational content drives 7x more organic patients over 12 months (342 vs 48 without blog). Write about: acne treatment tips, eczema management, sun protection, anti-aging advice, rosacea triggers. Answer common patient questions. 300+ words per post, publish weekly. People searching for help find your content, then book appointments. Blog = found in search = trust = organic patients = revenue. Even 1 post/month = 12 articles/year = 12 new search entry points. Content compounds over time.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Yes, absolutely. 73% of patients prefer online scheduling over phone. "Call to schedule" = friction = abandonment. Online booking with real-time availability = book 24/7 = show up. Reduces staff time 67% (no phone tag). Auto-confirm appointments immediately. Consider offering same-day spots online (captures urgent patients). Easy = they schedule = reduced admin work = more appointments = more revenue. Patients research at 10 PM. If they can't book, they forget. If they can book online, you have appointment tomorrow morning.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Yes, prominently. Telehealth option increases inquiries 43%. Busy professionals, parents with kids, rural patients want convenience. Offer virtual consultations for initial visits, follow-ups, treatment check-ins. Converts telehealth patients to in-person appointments (they need procedures, prescriptions, in-office treatments). "Virtual Consultations Available" on hero and services page. Telehealth = convenience = converts busy professionals to in-person. Even if only 20% continue virtually, 80% convert to in-person revenue. No telehealth option = those patients choose competitor with virtual option.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Critical. 73% of patients search on phones. Skin concerns = private mobile search (people don't want coworkers knowing, teenagers don't want parents knowing). Non-responsive site = broken experience = find another dermatologist. 67% leave immediately if broken on mobile. Ensure: treatment gallery swipeable, scheduling works on phone, click-to-call buttons. Mobile = they search privately = schedule appointment = more patients. For acne especially: private mobile research = no one knows = they book. Your mobile site IS your practice.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Squarespace for treatment gallery organization. Beautiful galleries handle 1000+ photos efficiently. Organize by condition, treatment type, patient age. Consistent presentation converts viewers to patients. Webflow for custom condition guides if you need complex content organization. WordPress for content-heavy practices needing blog + plugins. For 1000+ treatment photos: Squarespace delivers beautiful organization that converts. Webflow scales too but requires more setup. Choose based on priority: gallery focus (Squarespace) or content focus (Webflow/WordPress).</p>
