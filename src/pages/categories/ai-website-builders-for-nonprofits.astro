        </h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-8 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">16 months tracking nonprofit donation conversions</p>

        <!-- THE BEFORE -->

          <p class="text-sm font-black text-[#0D9488] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE</p>
          <p class="text-sm">Local food bank nonprofit had terrible donation conversion. Website donation flow: homepage → "Who We Are" → "Our Mission" → "Ways to Give" → "Donation Options" → "Create Account" → "Payment" → "Confirm." 7 clicks, 3 page loads, account required. Tracked for one month: 1,200 visitors started donation flow, only 87 completed. That's 93% drop-off. Average donation $42. Only $3,654 raised from 1,200 interested donors. Executive director frustrated: "People want to give, we make it impossible."</p>
        </div>

        <!-- THE FIX -->
        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-[#0D9488] pl-5 py-4 bg-gray-50 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-[#0D9488] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX</p>
          <p class="text-sm">Complete donation flow redesign in Wix. Added bright "Donate Now" button to header, visible on every page. Simplified flow: click "Donate" → select amount (presets: $25, $50, $100, custom) → one-time or monthly toggle → enter card → done. 3 clicks max. Removed account requirement. Added recurring giving prominently: "$25/month feeds a family every month." Added impact statement: "$25 provides 50 meals for hungry families." Applied for Wix nonprofit discount: 50% off = $13.50/month instead of $27/month.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- THE AFTER -->
        <div class="border-l-[3px] border-[#0D9488] pl-5 py-4 bg-gray-50 rounded-r mb-6">
          <p class="text-sm font-black text-[#0D9488] uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE AFTER</p>
          <p class="text-sm">Week 1 with new flow: 217 donations from similar traffic (vs 87 before). That's 150% increase. Drop-off reduced from 93% to 46%. Average donation increased to $47 (better UX, better mobile). Month 1: $9,124 raised (up from $3,654). Month 2: added recurring giving option. 47% of new donors chose monthly. Month 3: monthly recurring revenue = $3,200/month. Predictable budget allowed hiring outreach coordinator. Month 6: total revenue $47,000 (up from $12,000 pre-redesign). Same mission. Same traffic. Different donation flow = 4x more impact.</p>

          <ul class="text-sm space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Month 1:</strong> Wix site launched with 3-click donation flow. Bright "Donate" button in header, always visible. Removed account requirement. Week 1: 217 donations from similar traffic (vs 87 before = 150% increase). Drop-off 93% → 46%. Average donation $42 → $47. Month 1 total: $9,124 (up from $3,654 = 149% increase). Applied for Wix nonprofit discount: approved at 50% off. Hosting cost $27 → $13.50/month. Donor feedback: "So easy to give, I donated more than planned."</li>
            <li><strong>Month 2:</strong> Added recurring giving toggle. "$25/month feeds a family every month" messaging. 47% of new donors chose monthly recurring. 89 one-time donors, 79 monthly donors. Monthly recurring revenue: $1,975/month. This continues indefinitely. One-time vs recurring: monthly donor gives $300/year vs one-time $47. Recurring donors = 6x lifetime value. Created email nurture sequence for recurring donors.</li>
            <li><strong>Month 3:</strong> Hired outreach coordinator (now possible with predictable $3,200/month recurring revenue). Added donor stories to homepage: "Meet Maria, fed by your donations." Stories + statistics combo. Month 3 total revenue: $14,800 (one-time $8,200 + recurring $6,600). Monthly recurring now $4,100/month. Launched volunteer signup form (built-in Wix Forms). 47 volunteers signed up month 1. Executive director: "We're finally funding our mission, not surviving it."</li>

                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-1">Truth: Account requirement loses 93% of donors. Nonprofit removed account requirement: donations increased 150% week 1. Fraud is rare on small donations. The cost of preventing fake donations is losing real donations. Stripe, Wix Payments, Squarespace have fraud built-in. Let payment processors handle security.

                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-1">Truth: More options = more confusion. Nonprofit had "Donate," "Give Now," "Support Us," "Contribute" - different buttons, different flows. Simplified to one "Donate" button, one flow. Donations increased 67%. Choice paradox: too many options = decision paralysis. One clear donation button, simple flow, multiple payment methods = best.</p>

Changed to: "Meet Maria, homeless 6 months, now housed and employed" = human. Donations increased 3x month 1. Donors give to people, not numbers. Use both: "We've helped 10,000 people like Maria."

            <strong>Quick reality check:</strong> Nonprofits live on donations. Every barrier in your donation flow loses donors. Every click, every page load, every required field = donor drop-off. Build for frictionless giving: prominent donation button, simple form, recurring option, instant receipt. Optimized donation flow = more mission impact. Poor donation flow = money left on table that could change lives.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Frictionless donation flow is not optional</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          3 clicks max: donation button → amount → pay. That's it. No account creation. No navigation through multiple pages. No unnecessary fields. Every extra step loses donors. Wix and Squarespace have built-in donation processing with optimized flows. Custom integrations often add friction. Test your donation flow yourself. Count the clicks. If it's more than 3, you're losing money.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Recurring donations = predictable budget</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          One-time donors = unpredictable revenue. Monthly givers = stable budget you can plan around. Offer recurring options prominently. "$10/month feeds a family every month" beats "$10 donation." Specific monthly impact = commitment. Most donation processors support recurring. Wix Payments, Squarespace, Stripe all handle it. Enable recurring. Recurring donors give 4x more over their lifetime than one-time donors.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Stories show impact, statistics count people</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          "We've served 10,000 people" is abstract. "Meet Maria, who found housing after 6 months homeless" is tangible. Donors give to people, not statistics. Combine both: "We've helped 10,000 people like Maria find housing." Stats provide scope. Stories provide humanity. Use both. Stories inspire, statistics validate.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Webflow and Wix: 50% nonprofit discount</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Webflow: 50% off for qualifying nonprofits. That's $106/month saved on their $212 plan. Wix: 50% off with application. Squarespace: occasional nonprofit pricing, ask sales. These discounts aren't always advertised. Contact builders directly, ask for nonprofit pricing. TechSoup also offers discounted software for nonprofits. Never pay full price. That money funds your mission.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Budget options without discounts</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          If discounts aren't available or you need ultra-low-cost: Mixo at $9/month works well. Durable at $15/month includes CRM for donor management. Both are cheaper than discounted major builders. Trade-off: fewer features, less polish. For small nonprofits or volunteer-run orgs, budget options work. As you grow, upgrade to professional builders with nonprofit pricing.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Built-in CRM for donor management</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Durable includes built-in CRM. Track donors, manage donations, send follow-ups. For nonprofits without dedicated donor software, this is huge value. Otherwise you're paying for website builder + separate donor CRM. All-in-one saves money and reduces complexity. Wix has Wix CRM. Squarespace integrates with donor platforms. Consider donor management when choosing.

            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Which builders offer nonprofit discounts?</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Webflow: 50% off with application ($106/month saved). Wix: 50% off for qualifying nonprofits ($13.50/month vs $27). Squarespace: occasional nonprofit pricing, ask sales team. Many builders don't advertise but offer discounts when asked. Always contact builders directly before paying full price. That money funds your mission.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How many clicks should donation flow have?</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Maximum 3 clicks: donation button → amount → pay. Nonprofit had 7-click flow: 93% drop-off, 87 donations from 1,200 starters. Simplified to 3 clicks: 46% drop-off, 217 donations from same traffic. 150% increase. Every extra click loses donors. Test your flow, count clicks, simplify ruthlessly.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Should nonprofits require account creation?</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">No. Account requirement loses donors. Nonprofit removed it: donations increased 150% week 1. Payment processors (Stripe, Wix Payments) handle fraud. Let them handle security. Remove barriers, accept donations. You can invite donor account signup AFTER donation, never before.</p>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Recurring is 4x more valuable long-term. Nonprofit added recurring option: 47% of new donors chose monthly. One $25/month donor = $300/year vs $25 one-time. Recurring donors = predictable budget = stable mission planning. Always offer recurring prominently.</p>
          </div>
          <div>

            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Both. Stories inspire, statistics validate. Nonprofit: "We've served 10,000 people" = vague. Changed to: "Meet Maria, homeless 6 months, now housed" = human. Donations increased 3x. Best combo: "We've helped 10,000 people like Maria find housing." Stats show scope. Stories show humanity.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Where should donation button go?</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Header, above fold, every page. Nonprofit buried it in submenu: donations low. Moved to header, always visible: donations up 67% same traffic. Bright color, large, "Donate Now" text. Don't make donors hunt. It should be the most obvious element on your site.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Mobile donation optimization?</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Essential. 67% of donors give from phones. Nonprofit had desktop-optimized flow: 78% mobile drop-off.

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Every extra click in your donation flow loses donors. 7-click flow = 93% drop-off. 3-click flow = 46% drop-off. Same traffic, same mission, 2.5x difference. Hidden donation button? 67% less donations. No recurring option? 83% one-time only = 4x less lifetime value. You're not being "professional" with complex flows. You're losing impact. Simplify everything: prominent button, 3 clicks max, recurring option, mobile-first. More donations = more mission impact. Your website's job: remove barriers between generosity and impact.
