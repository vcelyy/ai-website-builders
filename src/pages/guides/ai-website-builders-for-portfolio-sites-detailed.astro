          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "For design portfolios, Framer is the top choice with the best designs in class (9.5/10), portfolio-quality presentation, and modern aesthetic perfect for showcasing creative work. Squarespace excels for photographers with beautiful image display, gallery layouts optimized for photos, and professional polish. Webflow serves developers and technical portfolios with code export, complete control, and developer-friendly features. Mixo provides the best budget option at $9/month for students, beginners, and those wanting clean professional layouts without high cost. For most portfolio sites, prioritize: showcasing your best work prominently above fold, high-quality images with fast loading, clear project organization and categorization, about section telling your story, easy contact or hire button, mobile optimization (many view on phones), and clean presentation that lets work shine. Your portfolio exists to get you hired - optimize for that goal."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Quality matters more than quantity for portfolios. 5-10 exceptional projects are better than 15-20 mediocre ones. Employers and clients want to see your best work, not everything you've ever done. Each project should represent work you're proud of and want more of. Early career: 8-12 projects showing range and potential. Mid-career: 6-10 projects representing your best and most relevant work. Established: 4-8 projects showing mastery and specialization. Remove outdated work that no longer represents your current skill level or direction. It's better to have a smaller portfolio of exceptional work than a larger portfolio with weak pieces. Your portfolio is only as strong as your weakest project. Curate ruthlessly and showcase only work that gets you excited to share. Quality, relevance, and recency matter more than volume."

          "text": "Portfolio websites need: (1) Hero section with your best work or strongest visual immediately visible, (2) Project gallery or grid showing your work at a glance, (3) Individual project pages with context - problem, your role, approach, outcome, (4) High-quality images or screenshots optimized for web, (5) About section telling your story, background, and what you do, (6) Contact information or hire me button prominently displayed, (7) Skills or services overview if seeking freelance work, (8) Resume or CV download option, (9) Social links - LinkedIn, GitHub, Dribbble, Behance as relevant, (10) Case studies for complex projects showing process, (11) Mobile optimization - many view portfolios on phones, (12) Fast loading - optimize images and code. key: show your best work, tell your story, make contact easy.

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes, AI builders work well for case studies with some limitations. Framer and Webflow support rich case study layouts with process sections, imagery, and storytelling. Dorik and Mixo offer case study templates for quick setup. For complex case studies needing custom layouts, Webflow's complete control or Framer's design flexibility work best. AI builders handle: project overview sections, before/after comparisons, process timeline display, image galleries, team information, results metrics. Limitations exist for: highly interactive case studies with complex animations, custom data visualizations, very long-form content (2000+ words). Best approach: use AI builders for standard case study formats, consider custom solutions for highly interactive or data-heavy case studies. Most portfolios need 3-5 detailed case studies showing process, not just final results."

        "name": "How do I optimize my portfolio for mobile viewing?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Mobile optimization is critical - 40-60% of portfolio views happen on phones. All AI website builders provide responsive templates, but test thoroughly. Key mobile optimization: large touch targets (44px minimum) for navigation, readable text without zooming (16px minimum), fast-loading images (compress to under 200KB each), simplified navigation that works without hover, stacked layouts instead of complex grids, visible contact information without scrolling, mobile-friendly galleries with swipe gestures. Test your portfolio on actual phones - not just browser dev tools. Common mobile issues: text too small, images slow to load, navigation menus hard to use, contact forms difficult to fill, galleries not swipeable. Fix these immediately - mobile users often represent decision-makers viewing your work on the go. A broken mobile portfolio loses clients."

        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Should I include pricing on my portfolio website?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Include pricing if you want qualified leads and fewer tire-kickers. Benefits: filters out clients who can't afford you, sets clear expectations, shows professionalism and transparency, reduces negotiation time. Drawbacks: prices may need frequent updates, could undercut you in negotiations, competitors can see your rates. Best approach: show pricing ranges or starting prices rather than exact amounts. For example: 'Website design projects start at $3,000' or 'Branding packages: $2,500-$8,000 depending on scope.' Include factors that affect pricing: project scope, timeline, usage rights, revisions included. Add 'contact for quote' for complex projects. For early career, showing starting prices helps establish credibility. For established professionals, 'pricing available upon request' often works better - it signals premium positioning and allows custom quoting based on project value."

      {

        "name": "How often should I update my portfolio website?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Update your portfolio quarterly at minimum, monthly for active freelancers. Add new completed projects promptly - stale portfolios signal inactivity. Review and remove outdated work that no longer represents your current skills or direction. Update your about section with recent experience, new skills, or career shifts. Refresh project images if better versions become available. Check and fix broken links quarterly. Update pricing or services information as it changes. Annually: complete portfolio audit, remove weakest projects, add 2-3 new strong pieces, refresh overall design if it looks dated, optimize for SEO with updated keywords, check mobile performance, update contact information across all platforms. Your portfolio is a living document, not a set-it-and-forget-it asset. Regular updates keep it relevant and show active engagement with your craft. Hiring managers notice outdated portfolios - they assume your skills are equally stale."

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What is the best AI website builder for portfolio sites?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">For design portfolios, <strong class="text-cyan-600">Framer</strong> is the top choice with the best designs in class (9.5/10), portfolio-quality presentation, and modern aesthetic perfect for showcasing creative work. <strong class="text-cyan-600">Squarespace</strong> excels for photographers with beautiful image display, gallery layouts optimized for photos, and professional polish. <strong class="text-cyan-600">Webflow</strong> serves developers and technical portfolios with code export, complete control, and developer-friendly features. <strong class="text-cyan-600">Mixo</strong> provides the best budget option at $9/month for students, beginners, and those wanting clean professional layouts without high cost. For most portfolio sites, prioritize: showcasing your best work prominently above fold, high-quality images with fast loading, clear project organization and categorization, about section telling your story, easy contact or hire button, mobile optimization (many view on phones), and clean presentation that lets work shine. Your portfolio exists to get you hired—optimize for that goal.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How many projects should a portfolio include?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Quality matters more than quantity for portfolios. <strong class="text-cyan-600">5-10 exceptional projects are better than 15-20 mediocre ones</strong>. Employers and clients want to see your best work, not everything you've ever done. Each project should represent work you're proud of and want more of. Early career: 8-12 projects showing range and potential. Mid-career: 6-10 projects representing your best and most relevant work. Established: 4-8 projects showing mastery and specialization. Remove outdated work that no longer represents your current skill level or direction. It's better to have a smaller portfolio of exceptional work than a larger portfolio with weak pieces. Your portfolio is only as strong as your weakest project. Curate ruthlessly and showcase only work that gets you excited to share. Quality, relevance, and recency matter more than volume.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">What features should portfolio websites include?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Portfolio websites need: (1) Hero section with your best work or strongest visual immediately visible, (2) Project gallery or grid showing your work at a glance, (3) Individual project pages with context—problem, your role, approach, outcome, (4) High-quality images or screenshots optimized for web, (5) About section telling your story, background, and what you do, (6) Contact information or hire me button prominently displayed, (7) Skills or services overview if seeking freelance work, (8) Resume or CV download option, (9) Social links—LinkedIn, GitHub, Dribbble, Behance as relevant, (10) Case studies for complex projects showing process, (11) Mobile optimization—many view portfolios on phones, (12) Fast loading—optimize images and code. key: show your best work, tell your story, make contact easy. Everything should support getting you hired or commissioned. Your portfolio is your primary marketing asset—inwesternvest in quality over quantity.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Can I use AI website builders for case studies?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Yes, AI builders work well for case studies with some limitations. <strong class="text-cyan-600">Framer and Webflow</strong> support rich case study layouts with process sections, imagery, and storytelling. <strong class="text-cyan-600">Dorik and Mixo</strong> offer case study templates for quick setup. For complex case studies needing custom layouts, Webflow's complete control or Framer's design flexibility work best. AI builders handle: project overview sections, before/after comparisons, process timeline display, image galleries, team information, results metrics. Limitations exist for: highly interactive case studies with complex animations, custom data visualizations, very long-form content (2000+ words). Best approach: use AI builders for standard case study formats, consider custom solutions for highly interactive or data-heavy case studies. Most portfolios need 3-5 detailed case studies showing process, not just final results.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How do I optimize my portfolio for mobile viewing?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Mobile optimization is critical—<strong class="text-cyan-600">40-60% of portfolio views happen on phones</strong>. All AI website builders provide responsive templates, but test thoroughly. Key mobile optimization: large touch targets (44px minimum) for navigation, readable text without zooming (16px minimum), fast-loading images (compress to under 200KB each), simplified navigation that works without hover, stacked layouts instead of complex grids, visible contact information without scrolling, mobile-friendly galleries with swipe gestures. Test your portfolio on actual phones—not just browser dev tools. Common mobile issues: text too small, images slow to load, navigation menus hard to use, contact forms difficult to fill, galleries not swipeable. Fix these immediately—mobile users often represent decision-makers viewing your work on the go. A broken mobile portfolio loses clients.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I include pricing on my portfolio website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Include pricing if you want qualified leads and fewer tire-kickers. Benefits: filters out clients who can't afford you, sets clear expectations, shows professionalism and transparency, reduces negotiation time. Drawbacks: prices may need frequent updates, could undercut you in negotiations, competitors can see your rates. Best approach: <strong class="text-cyan-600">show pricing ranges or starting prices rather than exact amounts</strong>. For example: "Website design projects start at $3,000" or "Branding packages: $2,500-$8,000 depending on scope." Include factors that affect pricing: project scope, timeline, usage rights, revisions included. Add "contact for quote" for complex projects. For early career, showing starting prices helps establish credibility. For established professionals, "pricing available upon request" often works better—it signals premium positioning and allows custom quoting based on project value.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">How often should I update my portfolio website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Update your portfolio <strong class="text-cyan-600">quarterly at minimum, monthly for active freelancers</strong>. Add new completed projects promptly—stale portfolios signal inactivity. Review and remove outdated work that no longer represents your current skills or direction. Update your about section with recent experience, new skills, or career shifts. Refresh project images if better versions become available. Check and fix broken links quarterly. Update pricing or services information as it changes. Annually: complete portfolio audit, remove weakest projects, add 2-3 new strong pieces, refresh overall design if it looks dated, optimize for SEO with updated keywords, check mobile performance, update contact information across all platforms. Your portfolio is a living document, not a set-it-and-forget-it asset. Regular updates keep it relevant and show active engagement with your craft. Hiring managers notice outdated portfolios—they assume your skills are equally stale.</p>

Best practices: Update quarterly with new work, remove outdated pieces, A/B test your homepage gallery, solicit feedback from peers, ensure all work has case study context, make your personality visible through design choices, include testimonials from past clients, show your process not just final results, price transparency can increase qualified inquiries by 40%, add subtle animations to showcase design skills.</p>
