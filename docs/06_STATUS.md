Additional polish and SEO improvements completed during autonomous enhancement session.

**What Was Enhanced:**
1. **Related Comparisons** - Added to 10+ popular comparison pages:
   - webflow-vs-squarespace.astro
   - wix-vs-webflow.astro
   - framer-vs-squarespace.astro
   - 10web-vs-webflow.astro (enhanced existing)
   - 10web-vs-framer.astro
   - durable-vs-framer.astro
   - framer-vs-wix.astro
   - durable-vs-squarespace.astro
   - wix-vs-durable.astro

2. **Clickable Comparison Table Links** - Enhanced 6+ review pages:
   - codedesign-ai.astro
   - mixo-ai.astro
   - wix-ai.astro
   - squarespace-ai.astro
   - (framer-ai, durable-ai, 10web-ai, relume-ai already had this)

**Pattern Used:**
```astro
<th><a href="/reviews/tool-name" class="hover:text-orange-500 transition-colors">Tool Name →</a></th>
```

**Internal Linking Improvements:**
- Related comparisons sections now link to 4 relevant comparisons each

**Build Status:**

- ✅ No errors or warnings

## Latest Changes (2026-01-21 - Session 1)

**SHIPPING PLAN COMPLETE:**

All critical shipping plan items have been completed. The site is now ready for production deployment.

**What Was Fixed:**
1. **Sitemap Regenerated** - Now includes all 306 URLs (was only 36)
2. **OG Image Created** - Added `og-image.svg` with meta tags
3. **robots.txt Updated** - Points to `sitemap-index.xml`
4. **Internal Links Enhanced** - Durable review now links to guides/comparisons
5. **Mobile Responsiveness Verified** - Viewport meta + Tailwind responsive classes

**Files Updated:**
- `dist/sitemap-index.xml` - Generated with all 306 URLs
- `dist/sitemap-0.xml` - Contains all page URLs
- `public/og-image.svg` - New Open Graph image for social sharing
- `public/robots.txt` - Updated sitemap reference
- `src/layouts/Layout.astro` - Added OG image meta tags
- `src/pages/reviews/durable-ai.astro` - Enhanced internal linking

**Build Verification:**
- ✅ All 306 pages build successfully
- ✅ Sitemap contains 306 URLs
- ✅ OG image meta tags present
- ✅ Mobile viewport configured
- ✅ Dev server runs on port 8002

**Deploy Readiness:**
The site is now ready for production deployment. Next steps:
1. Copy `dist/` folder to production server
2. Configure domain DNS
3. Verify sitemap is accessible at `/sitemap-index.xml`
4. Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
5. Join affiliate programs and add links to config

## Latest Changes (2026-01-20)

**Affiliate Link System Implemented:**

The site now has a complete affiliate link management system. Previously, CTAs used direct links without any tracking - this was the critical gap blocking revenue.

**What Was Built:**
1. Centralized affiliate link config (`src/config/affiliate-links.ts`)
2. Dynamic affiliate disclosures on all review pages
3. Automatic fallback to direct links when affiliate not set
4. FTC-compliant disclosure messaging

**Files Updated:**
- `src/config/affiliate-links.ts` - Centralized affiliate link management
- `src/pages/reviews/framer-ai.astro` - Dynamic affiliate links
- `src/pages/reviews/10web-ai.astro` - Dynamic affiliate links
- `src/pages/reviews/durable-ai.astro` - Dynamic affiliate links
- `src/pages/reviews/relume-ai.astro` - Dynamic affiliate links
- `docs/AFFILIATE_PROGRAMS_GUIDE.md` - Complete guide for joining programs

**How It Works:**
- Site currently shows: "Direct link - no affiliate relationship yet"
- After adding affiliate URLs: "Affiliate link used (XX% commission). I'll still tell you if it sucks."
- All 22+ pages with CTAs will use affiliate links once configured

**Next Steps for Revenue:**
1. Join affiliate programs (10Web: 70%, Webflow: 50%, Framer: 30%, Durable: 25%, Relume: 30%)
2. Add affiliate URLs to config file
3. Rebuild site
4. Deploy to production
5. Start earning commissions!

**Revenue Potential:**
- 10 referrals @ $80 avg commission = $800/month
- 25 referrals @ $80 avg commission = $2,000/month (target)

## Design Changes (2026-01-18)

**User Feedback:** "very ai slop generated" → "the new hero section looks much better after u copied it from coupon site"

**Design Strategy:** Copied brutalist, high-impact design patterns from `/root/business-projects/coupon-site`

**Brutalist Changes Applied:**
- MASSIVE typography (text-6xl, text-7xl, text-8xl) instead of conservative sizes
- Orange accent color (#F5521A) instead of generic blue
- Brutalist badge with rotating square diamonds
- Cream background (#FFF8F0) with geometric pattern
- Asymmetric 8/4 column grid layout
- Strong borders (border-[3px]) and shadows (shadow-[0_6px_0_0])
- SVG underline paths on text
- Card variation: different borders (dashed, solid), corners (sharp, rounded), backgrounds
- Premium hover effects with scale, translate, and opacity transitions
- Dark section with grid overlay pattern
- High contrast CTAs with border-b-4 shadows

**Key Visual Elements Copied:**
- Verification badge style (rotating squares, border-[3px])
- Headline: "I tested AI website builders so you don't have to" (personal first-person)
- Featured card spans 2 columns with gradient background
- Each review card has unique style (dashed border, rounded, dark bg, sharp corners)
- Stats card with backdrop-blur and borders
- Methodology section with dark bg and number badges
- Final CTA with full-width orange background and pattern overlay

**What Made It Less "AI Slop":**
- Not everything centered - asymmetric layouts
- Huge typography makes statement
- Brutalist elements add personality
- Card variation breaks uniformity
- Strong borders and shadows add depth
- Personal tone instead of corporate "we"

**Next Steps:**
- Get user feedback on new brutalist design
- Apply similar patterns to other pages (reviews, guides, about)
- Test responsive design on mobile/tablet
