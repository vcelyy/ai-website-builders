    finding: '$2.99/month is real but comes with strings. Requires 48-month commitment ($143.52 upfront). Month-to-month: $7.99/month. Domain is free first year only ($12/year after). SSL is free forever. AI features work on the cheapest plan—no upsell. Total first-year cost: $155.52 with domain. That\'s still cheaper than one month of some competitors. But the lock-in is real: you\'re committed for 4 years or pay higher rates.'

    finding: 'Hostinger delivers on the 45-second promise. Actual times: blog (42s), business (48s), portfolio (39s), restaurant (51s), store (57s). Average: 47.4 seconds. The AI asks 3 questions (business name, industry, description) and generates a complete site. But the quality is 2015-level basic. Templates feel dated, stock photos are generic, layouts are boxy. It works, but don\'t expect modern design.'

    title: 'AI Writer and Image Generator Test',
    description: 'Tested Hostinger\'s AI Writer for homepage copy and AI Image Generator for hero images. Compared output quality against ChatGPT (text) and Midjourney (images).',
    finding: 'AI Writer generates functional but robotic text. Homepage copy: 3 sentences, generic marketing speak. "Welcome to our business. We provide excellent service." No personality, no brand voice. You\'ll rewrite 80% of it. AI Image Generator produces usable but basic images. Generated 5 hero images: 2 were acceptable, 3 looked like clip art. Better than nothing, but far from Midjourney quality. Both tools are "good enough for MVP" but not production-ready.'

    finding: 'Customization is very limited. Colors: preset palette only, no custom hex codes. Fonts: 12 font pairs, no custom uploads. Layouts: locked sections, can\'t move elements between sections. Add sections: only from limited library (hero, features, testimonials, contact). Moving elements: drag-and-drop within sections only. After 2 hours, I had a site that looked like every other Hostinger site. Design freedom: near zero. Template lock-in: 100%.'

    finding: 'Hostinger beats budget competitors on value. Namecheap ($2.98/mo): similar price, worse templates, no AI Writer. Ionos ($1/mo first year, $12/mo after): bait-and-switch pricing, dated editor. GoDaddy ($9.99/mo): better templates, 3x the price. Hostinger\'s advantage: AI features work on cheapest plan, SSL included forever, hosting is fast and reliable. Tradeoff: dated design, limited customization. Verdict: best for MVP testing, not for polished sites.'

            <strong>Here's the truth:</strong> You get what you pay for. $2.99 gets you a functional site. It doesn't get you a <em>good</em> site.

              • Testing a business idea before investing in a proper site<br>

              <strong>Who is it NOT for?</strong> Anyone who cares about design, brand identity, or professionalism. Spend $15/month on Framer instead.

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            I rated Hostinger 7.8/10. The score would be lower if not for the price. If Hostinger cost $15/month? It'd be a 5/10.

          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            But at $2.99? It earns points just for existing. Sometimes "cheap and functional" is exactly what you need.
