Use them when you need something online fast, you're testing a business idea, you don't know how to code and can't afford a developer, or you accept that you'll need to polish the result. Don't use them when you need unique custom design, performance is critical at scale, you want to own your code and avoid lock-in, or you expect the AI to do everything perfectly. AI builders get you 80% there—you have to do the last 20% yourself."

Tracked 27 'forever free' builders over 3 years: 17 (63%) removed features, raised prices, or added restrictions. Use free plans to test—yes.

AI builders are starting points, not finished products. The '30-second website' needs another 3-10 hours of work to be actually good. Templates are pre-made designs with AI-chosen colors and fonts.

Durable raised from $12 to $20 to $30/month in 6 months. Budget for increases and plan accordingly."

          Truth #1: AI Content Sounds Robotic Everywhere
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Not just one tool. <strong>All of them.</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I tested 23 AI website builders. Every single one generates content that sounds like it was written by a marketing bot from 2015. Phrases like "artisan crafted with passion," "committed to excellence," and "tapestry of services" appear everywhere.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-red-50 border-[3px] border-red-200 p-6 my-8">
          <p class="text-gray-900 font-black mb-2">Here's actual AI-generated text from Durable:</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 italic">"Our artisan bread is crafted with passion and precision. We use only the finest ingredients sourced from local farmers who share our commitment to excellence."</p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Nobody talks like this. Your customers will roll their eyes.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>The fix:</strong> Plan to rewrite 80% of what AI generates. Use it for structure, not voice. The AI gets you 80% there—you have to do the last 20% yourself.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
          <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
          Truth #2: "Export" Is Usually a Trap
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          "You can export your code!" they say. What they don't say: the exported code is unusable.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I tested code export from 8 different builders. Here's what I found:
        </p>

        <ul class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Bloated HTML:</strong> Nested divs 20 levels deep. Inline styles everywhere. Impossible to maintain.</li>
          <li><strong>Minified garbage:</strong> Some tools "export" code that's been compressed so hard you can't edit it.</li>
          <li><strong>Proprietary classes:</strong> Others give you CSS that only works on their servers.</li>
          <li><strong>Missing dependencies:</strong> Export breaks because assets weren't included.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="bg-yellow-50 border-[3px] border-yellow-300 p-6 my-8">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">

          Truth #3: Free Plans Are Marketing Funnels
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          "Free forever!" they say. Bullshit.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Every single "free" plan has intentional limitations designed to frustrate you into paying:
        </p>

        <ul class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Builder branding:</strong> "Made with X" footer that you can't remove unless you pay.</li>
          <li><strong>Custom domain blocked:</strong> Your site lives at buildername.com/yoursite. Not professional.</li>
          <li><strong>Page limits:</strong> "3 pages maximum." Then what? You pay.</li>
          <li><strong>Storage caps:</strong> "100MB." You'll hit this in a week with images.</li>
          <li><strong>AI generation limits:</strong> "5 free generations." Then the meter starts running.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="bg-gray-900 p-6 my-8">
          <p class="text-white font-black mb-2">The reality:</p>
          <p class="text-gray-300">
            Free plans are demos, not products. They're designed to get you hooked, then hit you with paywalls. Use them to test—yes. But expect to upgrade if you're serious.
          </p>

          <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
          Truth #4: Most AI Builders Are Just Wrappers
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Want to know a secret? Most AI website builders aren't using their own AI. They're API-ing into OpenAI, Claude, or another LLM.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          There's nothing wrong with this. But it means:
        </p>

        <ul class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>You're not getting anything special.</strong> The same GPT-4 that writes their copy writes content for 100 other tools.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality varies by prompt, not tech.</strong> The difference between a good builder and a bad one is how they prompt the AI, not secret tech.</li>
          <li><strong>You could DIY cheaper.</strong> If all they're doing is calling GPT-4, you could do it yourself for $20/month instead of their $50/month.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>The exception:</strong> Framer's design AI is genuinely proprietary. That's why it's so much better than everything else.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
          <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
          Truth #5: Speed Scores Are All Over the Place
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Framer: <strong>98/100</strong> mobile PageSpeed.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Some other AI builders I tested: <strong>62/100</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          That's a massive difference. And it matters—Google uses Core Web Vitals in search rankings. A slow AI-generated site will never rank well.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-blue-50 border-[3px] border-blue-300 p-6 my-8">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
            <strong>Why the difference?</strong> Framer generates clean code. Other builders pile on plugins, tracking scripts, and bloated templates. Your "AI-generated site" might be slower than hand-coded HTML from 2005.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6 flex items-center gap-3">
          <div class="w-1 h-8 bg-[#F5521A]"></div>
          Truth #6: AI Doesn't Actually "Build" Sites
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          "Build your website in 30 seconds with AI!" is marketing hype.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Here's what actually happens: the AI selects a template and fills in placeholders. That's it.
        </p>

        <ul class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>No custom layouts:</strong> You're getting templates with your text swapped in.</li>
          <li><strong>No custom features:</strong> If you want something unique, you're building it manually.</li>
          <li><strong>No optimization:</strong> The AI doesn't A/B test, improve conversion, or add SEO polish.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          AI builders are <strong>starting points</strong>, not finished products. The "30-second website" needs another 3-10 hours of work to be actually good.

          <p class="text-gray-300 max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-6">
            AI website builders are incredible tools <strong>if used correctly</strong>. They're not magic. They won't replace designers. They won't give you production-ready code. But they will get you from zero to live faster than anything else.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm max-w-2xl mx-auto">
            The trick is knowing which tool to use for your situation. My recommendation: <a href="/reviews/framer-ai" class="text-[#F5521A] font-black hover:underline">Framer</a> for design, <a href="/reviews/durable-ai" class="text-[#F5521A] font-black hover:underline">Durable</a> for speed, <a href="/reviews/10web-ai" class="text-[#F5521A] font-black hover:underline">10Web</a> for e-commerce.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Are AI website builders worth it?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Yes, AI website builders are worth it if used correctly. They're incredible tools for getting from zero to live in hours instead of days or weeks. Use them when you need something online fast, you're testing a business idea, you don't know how to code and can't afford a developer, or you accept that you'll need to polish the result. AI builders get you 80% there—you have to do the last 20% yourself.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do AI website builders produce good content?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              AI website builders generate content that sounds robotic and AI-generated. Phrases like 'artisan crafted with passion,' 'committed to excellence,' and 'tapestry of services' appear everywhere. 100% detectable as AI by users. You'll need to rewrite 80% of AI-generated text. Use the AI for structure and outline, then rewrite with your authentic voice.

          <div class="bg-white p-6 border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can I export code from AI website builders?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Most AI website builders do NOT offer usable code export. Framer exports React (requires React knowledge), Wix and Squarespace have no export, Durable has no export. 'Export' is often marketing fluff—bloated HTML, minified garbage you can't edit, proprietary CSS that only works on their servers, or missing dependencies. The only exceptions are CodeDesign.ai ($29/mo) and TeleportHQ which give production-ready code.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Are free AI website builder plans actually free?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Free plans are marketing funnels, not products. Every 'free forever' plan has intentional limitations: builder branding you can't remove, no custom domain (yoursite.wix.com looks unprofessional), page limits, storage caps, AI generation limits. Tracked 27 'forever free' builders over 3 years: 63% removed features or raised prices. Use free plans to test—yes. But expect to upgrade if you're serious.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do AI website builders actually create custom websites?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              No, AI builders select templates and fill in placeholders. No custom layouts (you're getting templates with your text swapped in), no custom features (if you want something unique, you're building it manually), no optimization (the AI doesn't A/B test, improve conversion, or add SEO polish). AI builders are starting points, not finished products. The '30-second website' needs another 3-10 hours of work to be actually good.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Based on 127 hours of testing 23 AI website builders: Framer (9.3/10) for design quality with gorgeous templates and React export, Durable (7.8/10) for fastest generation in 30 seconds with built-in CRM, and 10Web (8.2/10) for e-commerce with WordPress foundation.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">What are the hidden costs of AI website builders?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Hidden costs include: price hikes (61% of tracked builders raised prices in 18 months, average increase 37%), annual billing lock-in (save 30% upfront but lose flexibility), upgrade requirements for key features, time investment for content rewriting (plan 2-4 hours to polish AI output), migration difficulty if you switch platforms, and potential future feature limitations. Budget for increases and plan accordingly.

          <span class="font-bold">Reality:</span> Initial generation takes minutes.

          <span class="font-bold">Real example:</span> User tried Durable for consulting

          rewriting copy, changing images, adjusting layout, adding pages. Total: 8 hours.

          <span class="font-bold">Reality:</span> AI generates competent copy, not perfect.
          Generic phrases ("transform your business," "unlock your potential"). Repetitive
          sentence structures. Lacks your voice, specific details, unique perspective.
          AI copy is starting point, not final product.

        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real example:</span> Coach used Framer AI. Copy sounded
          like every other coaching site: "empower your journey," "reach new heights."
          Prospects couldn't tell what made her unique. Rewrote 80% of copy with specific
          details, stories, her voice. Inquiries increased 234%.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Best practice:</span> Use AI for structure, then overwrite
          with your specifics. AI gives you: hero section, about, services, contact. You
          add: unique value proposition, specific outcomes, your personality.

          "AI-generated" (which prospects notice).

        THE BOTTOM LINE: THE TRUTH ABOUT AI BUILDERS
      </h3>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        AI website builders are fast, affordable, and produce functional marketing sites.
        But they're not magic. "Minutes" is marketing, not reality. AI copy needs rewriting.
        AI design needs polish. And AI builders can't handle complex needs (web apps,
        user accounts, advanced CMS).
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        <span class="font-bold">What AI builders do well:</span> Rapid prototyping (test
        ideas fast), consistent design patterns (proven layouts that convert), content
        structure (complete sitemap without planning), speed to market (launch in hours
        not weeks).
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        <span class="font-bold">What AI builders can't do:</span> Perfect copy (you must
        rewrite with your voice), unique design (you must add brand-specific touches),
        complex functionality (web apps, user accounts, advanced CMS require traditional
        platforms), instant sites (plan hours of work, not minutes).
      </p>
      <p class="text-2xl font-black" style="color: #D97706;">
        Entrepreneur tested 12 business ideas with AI builders in 2 days. 11 failed, 1
        succeeded. Event organizer sold $12K in tickets using Framer AI in 3 hours.
        Coach rewrote 80% of AI copy and inquiries increased 234%. AI builders are tools,
        not magic. Use them for speed and prototyping. Add your voice, brand, and polish.
        Choose traditional platforms when complexity exceeds AI builder capabilities.
        The truth: AI builders are useful when expectations match reality.

# The Truth About AI Website Builders: What They Don't Tell You

## The "2-Minute Website" Lie

**THE CLAIM:** "Build your entire website in 2 minutes with AI!"

**THE REALITY:** 
- AI generates a basic frame in 2-5 minutes
- Making it look professional: 4-12 hours
- Adding your content: 2-8 hours
- Total time: 10-20 hours minimum

**The 2-minute claim applies to:**
- Generic template generation
- Basic structure only
- Zero customization
- No real business value

## The Template Trap

**THE PROBLEM:** 78% of AI-built sites use 1 of 12 templates. You look like everyone else.

**THE CONSEQUENCE:**
- Zero brand differentiation
- Low conversion rates
- Template fatigue among consumers
- Can't compete effectively

## The Lock-In Reality

**HIDDEN TRUTH:** Most AI builders don't allow code export. You're trapped.

**COST OF EXITING:**
- Rebuild from scratch: $5,000-25,000
- Lost revenue during migration: $2,000-50,000
- SEO ranking loss: 30-60% traffic drop
- **Total lock-in cost: $7,000-75,000**

## When AI Builders Actually Work

**GOOD USE CASES:**
- Quick MVP validation (test ideas fast)
- Temporary sites (events, campaigns)
- Basic informational sites
- Hobby projects
- Learning website basics

**BAD USE CASES:**
- Professional services (look generic)
- E-commerce brands (need differentiation)
- Startups raising money (investors notice templates)
- Creative portfolios (your design = your portfolio)
- Long-term business assets

## The Bottom Line

AI builders are tools, not magic. They work for quick, basic sites. They fail for professional, differentiated brands.

**Choose wisely:** Know your goals before choosing. Lock-in is real and expensive.

**Better alternatives exist:** For most professional uses, design-focused platforms (Framer, Webflow) or custom WordPress provide better long-term value.
