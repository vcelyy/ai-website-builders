Brilliant attorneys with Harvard/Yale pedigrees. Website from 2015: looked like Geocities 1999, broken mobile, no attorney photos, generic "We fight for your rights" copy, zero case studies, no legal content. Competitors charging $200-300/hour had beautiful websites with attorney profiles, case results, blog content.

Corporate attorney with 2005-style site: prospects asked "If he's this outdated, is he behind on case law too?" Rebuilt: client acquisition cost dropped 40%.
