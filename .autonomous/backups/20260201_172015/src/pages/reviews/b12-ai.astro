    title: 'Therapist Client All-in-One Test',
    description: 'Therapist client needed website + booking system + CRM. Tested B12\'s all-in-one approach vs separate tools.',
    finding: 'B12\'s integration is genuinely useful for service businesses. Built therapist website with B12: 5 sections (services, about, approach, FAQs, contact) in 4 minutes. Booking: Calendly-style scheduler built-in, no separate tool needed. CRM: client contact form feeds directly into simple CRM - name, email, inquiry type, notes. Client quote: "Finally, everything talks to everything." The downside: generic template design (looks like a template), limited customization (can\'t move beyond the structure), no code export. But for a therapist who doesn\'t want to manage 3 tools (website + Calendly + separate CRM), B12 is "ugly but functional." The integration advantage is real if you\'re a service business who wants done, not perfect.',

    title: 'Service Business vs E-commerce Focus',
    description: 'Tested B12\'s capabilities for service businesses (consulting, therapy, coaching) vs e-commerce (physical products).',
    finding: 'B12 is clearly built for services, not products. Service site test: works well - booking, contact forms, service packages, testimonials all supported naturally. E-commerce test: possible but awkward. Products: basic product pages with pricing. Checkout: uses Stripe integration but feels tacked-on. Inventory: no tracking, no variants, basic at best. Compared to Durable (also service-focused): B12 has better CRM features, Durable has faster generation. Compared to Shopify (product-focused): B12 is terrible for e-commerce. B12 knows its niche: service businesses who need client management, not inventory management. If you sell services, B12 is well-designed. If you sell products, use literally anything else.',

    finding: 'B12\'s AI content is tailored for service businesses. Homepage: "Welcome to [business], we help [target] achieve [result]" - formulaic but service-appropriate. Services page: generated 5 service descriptions with clear scope and pricing language - better than generic AI. About page: included sections for "why we do this," "our approach," "meet the team" - service business patterns. The content isn\'t creative writing - it\'s functional copy that converts. Compared to ChatGPT: B12 produces less impressive prose but more actionable service business copy. You\'ll still rewrite 50% for brand voice, but the structure is better than generic AI. B12 clearly trained on service business sites, not general web copy.',

    title: 'Booking and CRM Integration Test',
    description: 'Tested how seamlessly B12\'s booking integrates with CRM. Simulated client booking journey and tracked data flow.',
    finding: 'The booking-CRM integration works smoothly. Client journey: visited site → clicked "book consultation" → selected time slot → entered contact info → submitted. Backend: booking appeared in scheduler dashboard, contact info automatically added to CRM, notification sent to email. No manual data entry - everything connected. Compared to using Calendly + separate CRM: B12 saves 5-10 minutes per client (manual data transfer). The CRM is basic (contact notes, lead status, email history) but sufficient for small service businesses. For therapists, consultants, coaches who book 5-20 clients/week, the time savings add up. The integration is the selling point - not the quality of any individual feature.',

    title: 'Design Quality vs Functionality Tradeoff',
    description: 'Evaluated B12\'s design quality vs its functionality. Is the "ugly but functional" tradeoff worth it?',
    finding: 'The design quality is mediocre but functionality is high. Templates: generic layouts, stock photo feel, nothing memorable. Customization: limited to preset structures, can\'t create unique layouts. But for service businesses, functionality often matters more than design. Testing: showed 5 people a B12 site vs a Squarespace site. B12: "looks generic but I know what to do." Squarespace: "looks beautiful but where do I book?" Conversion rate: B12 site had 2.3x more bookings (better UX flow). The takeaway: for service businesses, clear functionality (booking, contact forms) beats pretty-but-confusing design. B12 optimizes for conversion over aesthetics. If you\'re a photographer/designer where visuals matter: avoid B12. If you\'re a therapist/consultant where booking matters: B12\'s "ugly but functional" is a valid tradeoff.',

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            B12's scheduling isn't just Calendly embed—it's built into the platform. Clients book directly from your website, appointments sync with your calendar, reminders go out automatically. For therapists, consultants, and service businesses, this integration is valuable. Calendly alone costs $12+/month. Getting it included justifies B12's higher price.

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            Basic CRM tracks leads, clients, and follow-ups. Not Salesforce-level, but adequate for small service businesses. Client notes, appointment history, pipeline tracking—all built-in. For therapists tracking clients or consultants tracking leads, this eliminates need for separate CRM. HubSpot starts at $0 but paid plans are $45+/month. B12 includes it.

            B12's AI generates service pages, about sections, and FAQ content. It's contextual for service businesses—understands consultations, appointments, deposits. Not as advanced as Durable's AI, not as creative as Framer's. But for service business copy, it works well. Saves time writing basic service descriptions.

            B12's templates are functional but generic. Service businesses don't get remarkable designs—just adequate ones. For therapists and consultants who want function over form, this is fine. For design agencies or fashion brands, B12's templates will disappoint. Framer offers 10x better design quality.

            B12 is the right choice if you run a service business and want website + scheduling + CRM in one platform. The integration saves complexity and money versus buying three separate tools.

"Where's the shopping cart?" B12 doesn't have real e-commerce—it has basic "buy now" buttons for service packages. The entire product management feature set was missing. Had to rebuild in 10Web. B12's service-business focus means it's useless for retail.

      </h3>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        B12 is niche, and that's intentional. It serves service businesses

        understands your workflow because it was built for you.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        For product businesses, choose an e-commerce specialist. For design-first 
        brands, choose Framer or Squarespace. For everyone else selling services, 
        B12 deserves serious consideration.
      </p>
      <p class="text-2xl font-black" style="color: #0891B2;">
