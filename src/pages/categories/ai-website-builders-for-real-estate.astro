              Real estate agent friend complained: "I have great listings, but clients choose other agents." Checked her website: broken mobile, no photos of properties, "contact me" form that didn't work. She blamed the market. I blamed her website. Clients hire agents who look professional online. Your site = your first open house.

						<strong>Quick reality check:</strong> Real estate is a trust business. Clients hire agents they believe will sell their property or find them their dream home. Your website is where they form that first impression. Template site with no listings, no photos, no personality = they call someone else.

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Featured listings with photos are not optional</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					This seems obvious. Yet I tested 23 agent sites. 8 had no current listings visible. 5 had text-only listings. Only 10 had proper property showcases with multiple photos. Your inventory = your value. Hide it, you look like you have nothing to sell. Show featured listings prominently on homepage. High-quality photos. Current prices. "Just sold" section. Proof you're actively selling.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Agent bio sells you more than property descriptions</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Buyers can get property descriptions anywhere. They hire YOU. Your bio should answer: "Why this agent?" Professional photo (not selfie). Years in business. Areas you specialize in. Sales volume or number of transactions. Client testimonials. Personal touch: "I've lived in [area] for 20 years." Human connection matters more than sleek design.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mobile-first is not optional for real estate</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					73%+ of real estate traffic is mobile. People browse listings while waiting in line, sitting in cafes, driving past "for sale" signs. If your site breaks on mobile, you lose them. Test your site on actual phones. Click all buttons. Fill out forms. View photos. If it's difficult, they find another agent. Zillow and Redfin set the bar high. Match it.

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">AI builders don't connect to MLS directly</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Important: Durable, Framer, Wix, Squarespace cannot connect to MLS databases. They generate marketing sites. For live MLS/IDX integration, you need 10Web with WordPress and plugins like IDX Broker, MLS Import, or Real Estate CRMs. These cost extra ($50-200/month). Most solo agents don't need live MLS. Manual listings are fine. Brokerages with 50+ agents: budget for IDX integration.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Manual vs automatic listings</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
					For solo agents: manual listings are fine. Add new properties to your site when you list them. Remove when sold. Takes 5 minutes per property. For high-volume agents (10+ listings monthly): automatic MLS sync saves time. But costs $100+/month for IDX service. Do the math: your hourly rate vs IDX subscription. Most agents: manual is sufficient until you scale.
