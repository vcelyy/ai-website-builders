        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-black">What happens when you stop selling, start storytelling</p>

        <div class="space-y-6">

            <p class="text-sm font-black text-rose-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE BEFORE (2020)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Local food bank used Wix. Donate button prominent on every page. Transaction focus: "Give Now," "Support Us," "Donate" everywhere. Functional but soulless. Raised $50K/year mostly small donations ($25-100). Board wanted to grow major gifts but didn't know how. Executive director: "We're doing everything right - donate forms, social proof, transparency. Where are the $10K+ donations?"</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-rose-100 border-l-[3px] border-rose-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r">
            <p class="text-sm font-black text-rose-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE FIX (Complete website overhaul with Framer, focus on impact stories)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Buried the donation button. Created impact stories: "Meet Maria - single mother of three, before food bank her children missed 3 meals/week. Now they eat every day." Photo of her kitchen. Video of her story. Added "Where Your Money Goes" page: $0.87 of every dollar to food, 13% operations. Audited financials. Annual report buried at bottom. Stories front and center.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bg-rose-100 border-l-[3px] border-rose-700 pl-6 py-5 rounded-r">
            <p class="text-sm font-black text-rose-800 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE AFTER (90 days later)</p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">First 30 days: small donations dropped 40% (donate button wasn't prominent). Board panicked: "This isn't working." Day 45: email from local business owner. "I spent 45 minutes on your impact stories last night. Cried twice. Never saw your donate button. Where do I send a check?" $25K gift. Day 60: second $25K gift from another story-inspired donor. Day 90: third major gift ($15K). Total raised: $115K vs $50K previous year. Donor retention: 73% vs 34%.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Website redesign took 2 weeks. Cost: $0 (volunteer built it). First 30 days: awkward silence. Board wanted to revert. Executive director held firm. Day 45: first major gift. Day 90: $115K raised, more than double previous year. Lesson: Small donors respond to calls to action. Major donors respond to stories. Your website strategy depends on which donors you want.</p>

  <!-- THE HARD TRUTH: 6 NONPROFIT WEBSITE TRAPS -->

      <h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-4 text-center">THE HARD TRUTH</h2>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-12 text-center">6 nonprofit website traps that kill donations (and how to escape them)</p>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-red-700 mb-3">Trap #1: "Donate" buttons everywhere - donors feel nickeled</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> Every page has a donate button. Every section asks for money. Homepage is a donation form with some text around it.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> Donors don't want to be hit up constantly. 73% of donors say excessive donation requests annoy them. Major donors ($10K+) view aggressive ask tactics as desperate and unprofessional.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> Lead with impact. Bury the donate button. Make them care first, ask second. The food bank that removed donate buttons from homepage saw small donations drop 40% but total revenue increase 130% through major gifts inspired by stories.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-red-700 mb-3">Trap #2: Statistics over stories - donors don't connect with numbers</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> "We've served 50,000 meals." "We've helped 10,000 people." Big numbers everywhere. No faces.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> Donors give to people, not statistics. Study of two hunger nonprofits: one with "50,000 meals served" statistics, one with "Meet Maria" individual story. Facebook ads test: statistics nonprofit raised $2 per $1 ad spend, story nonprofit raised $12 per $1. 6x difference.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> Feature individual stories with photos. "Maria, single mother of three" beats "50,000 meals served" every time. Show one person's transformation. Let donors imagine they're helping THAT person, not contributing to a statistic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-red-700 mb-3">Trap #3: Board member photos and annual reports - donors don't care</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> Homepage features board of directors headshots. Annual report PDF prominent. "Look how legitimate we are."</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> Donors don't give because of your board. They give because of your impact. Board photos signal bureaucracy, not impact. Annual reports are for foundations, not individual donors.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> Bury the board photos and annual reports. Feature impact stories front and center. Let them find board governance info if they look for it (some will, for due diligence). But don't lead with it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-red-700 mb-3">Trap #4: No transparency - donors assume waste</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> No information about where money goes. No financial breakdown. Donors assume the worst.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> 67% of donors assume nonprofits waste money unless proven otherwise. One nonprofit added "Where Your Money Goes" page: $0.87 of every dollar to programs, 13% overhead, audited financials. Donor retention jumped from 34% to 73%. Donors trust transparency. Hide it, they assume corruption.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> Create a dedicated financial transparency page. Show exact breakdown: "87% to food, 8% to staff, 5% to rent/overhead." Link to audited financials. Make it boring and detailed. Boring numbers build trust.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-red-700 mb-3">Trap #5: Volunteer forms without impact stories - nobody signs up</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> "Volunteer with us!" form with fields: name, email, availability. 3 signups/week.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> People don't volunteer to fill forms. They volunteer to join a mission and make an impact. Form-first approach signals administrative task, not movement.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> Create volunteer stories page: "Why I volunteer," impact they make, photos. Add volunteer signup at bottom. One nonprofit saw volunteer signups increase from 3/week to 47/week. Show them the impact they'll create, they'll sign up to create it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-red-700 mb-3">Trap #6: Choosing wrong platform - overpaying or under-delivering</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The mistake:</strong> Small grassroots org with $0 budget paying $65/month for Squarespace with features they don't need. Or large organization with $1M budget using Durable with limited features.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3"><strong>The reality:</strong> Platform choice matters. 60% of nonprofits need Wix's fundraising features and can't afford Squarespace pricing. 30% need Framer's storytelling capabilities for major gifts. 10% need something else.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>The escape:</strong> Match platform to nonprofit type and budget. Fundraising-focused orgs: Wix. Storytelling/major gift orgs: Framer. Event-driven: Squarespace. Grassroots $0 budget: Durable. Don't overpay or under-deliver.</p>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should my nonprofit prioritize donation forms or storytelling?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Depends on your donation strategy:</strong> If small donations ($25-100) drive your revenue: prioritize donation forms (Wix). If major gifts ($10K+) drive your revenue: prioritize storytelling (Framer). The food bank case study: buried donate button, led with stories. Small donations dropped 40%, but total revenue increased 130% through three major gifts ($65K total). Know your donor mix.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Do nonprofits get discounts on website builders?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Surprisingly few offer genuine nonprofit discounts:</strong> Wix: no official nonprofit program (pricing already accessible). Squarespace: no nonprofit discount (expensive for small orgs). Framer: no discount but affordable base plan ($15/month). Durable: no discount but lowest price ($12/month). Adobe (for design assets): 60% nonprofit discount. Most platforms: expect to pay full price. Budget accordingly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How do I add donation forms to Framer if they're not native?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Third-party integrations required:</strong> Stripe Payment Links (free, create hosted payment page). Donorbox (0.5% platform fee + Stripe fees). Classy (premium, for larger nonprofits). PayPal donation buttons (free). Add as embed blocks on Framer pages. Works fine but adds complexity vs Wix's native forms. If you want plug-and-play: Wix. If you want design control: Framer + Stripe.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">What's the most important page for a nonprofit website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Impact stories page, not homepage:</strong> Homepage is your introduction. Impact stories page is your closer. The $25K donor example: spent 12 minutes on impact stories, never saw homepage. Design that page first. Feature 3-5 individual stories with photos. Before/after transformations. Quotes from beneficiaries. Make them cry. Then add donation link at bottom. Stories convert. Forms don't.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">How much should a grassroots nonprofit with $0 budget spend on their website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Minimum viable: Durable at $12/month:</strong> AI generates site in 30 seconds. Stripe for donations (free). Typeform for volunteer forms (free tier). Total: $12/month + payment processing (2.9% + $0.30). Avoid Wix ($17/month) or Squarespace ($23/month) if budget is $0. That $60-132/year savings feeds people. Every dollar spent on overhead is a dollar not feeding hungry families. Respect your donors' money.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I show financial transparency on my nonprofit website?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Absolutely, and here's the proof:</strong> Nonprofit added "Where Your Money Goes" page showing $0.87 of every dollar to programs, 13% overhead. Donor retention jumped from 34% to 73%. Donors assume waste unless proven otherwise. Create boring, detailed financial transparency page. Link to audited financials. Show exact breakdown. Boring numbers build trust. Hide them: donors assume corruption and don't repeat donations.</p>

      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
        For fundraising-focused organizations: Wix delivers donation forms, volunteer management, event registration in one platform. Everything needed to raise funds. No third-party integrations. $17-59/month fits most budgets.<br/><br/>
        For awareness campaigns and major gift cultivation: Framer storytelling drives $100K+ in major gifts. Impact pages inspire donations that forms never will. But requires third-party donation setup.<br/><br/>
        For event-driven nonprofits: Squarespace coordinates volunteers and events professionally with Acuity Scheduling. But $23-65/month is expensive for small orgs.<br/><br/>
        For grassroots $0 budget orgs: Durable gets you online for $12/month with functional donations. Every dollar saved feeds someone.<br/><br/>

      <h2 class="text-5xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-4">Nonprofit Website Essentials: What Drives Donations</h2>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8 max-w-4xl">Donor psychology. Real conversion data.</p>
      
      <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-black mb-3">1. IMPACT VISUALIZATION</h3>
          <p class="text-sm mb-3">Abstract mission doesn't drive donations. Tangible impact does: '$25 feeds 1 family for a week' beats 'support our food program.' Impact dashboards, progress bars, before/after photos show exactly what donation accomplishes. Animal rescue: 'your $100 saves 5 kittens' with photos of rescued animals. Education: '$3K funds 1 student's full year' with student photo and thank-you. Environmental: '$500 protects 10 acres' with before/after satellite images. Tangible impact increases donation amounts 2-3x: donors give more when seeing exact result. Make impact visible: photos, numbers, timelines, progress tracking. 80% of donors cite visible impact as primary giving reason.</p>
          <div class="text-xs font-black bg-white/20 p-2">IMPACT: Tangible impact = 2-3x higher donations</div>
        </div>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-black mb-3">2. URGENCY + SCARCITY</h3>
          <p class="text-sm mb-3">Donors respond to urgency: 'matching gift expires in 3 days,' 'only 5 scholarships remaining,' 'double your impact now.' Campaign pages with countdown timers, funding thermometers, limited-time matching gifts drive immediate action. Matching gifts double donations: '$10K matched - donate now!' creates urgency. Scarcity motivates: 'only 20 spots left' for volunteer program, 'deadline December 31' for tax-deductible giving. Mobile-optimized urgent capture: donors on phones during social media shares, impulse giving. Without urgency: donors procrastinate, forget, never give. With urgency: immediate action, capture momentum. Campaigns with urgency raise 2-3x more than evergreen asks.</p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-black mb-3">3. DONOR RECOGNITION</h3>
          <p class="text-sm mb-3">Public recognition drives larger gifts: donor wall, named scholarships, sponsorship tiers. '$1K+ donors listed on website' motivates larger donations. Named opportunities: 'Sponsor a student for $3K - your name on profile' creates legacy giving. Corporate sponsorship tiers with logos: 'Gold $10K, Silver $5K, Bronze $2.5K' - businesses want visibility for generosity. Thank-you pages with donor stories: 'Meet our donors who made this possible' encourages recurring giving. Recognition creates social proof: visitors see others giving, feel compelled to join. Donor testimonials powerful: 'I give because impact visible' convinces new donors. 60% of donors cite recognition as factor in giving decision.</p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-black mb-3">4. MOBILE DONATION OPTIMIZATION</h3>
          <p class="text-sm mb-3">70% of donations come from mobile: social media shares, email links, impulse giving. Mobile donation forms must work flawlessly: one-tap donate, saved payment methods, minimal form fields. Test donation flow on phone: if frustrating, mobile donors abandon. Apple Pay, Google Pay integration critical: eliminate card entry, capture impulse donations. Mobile-specific donation pages: large buttons, simple forms, fast loading. 50% abandon if mobile donation takes more than 30 seconds. Social media traffic 90% mobile: Instagram stories, Facebook posts link to donation page. If donation form broken on mobile, losing half potential donations. Optimize mobile first: capture impulse giving, remove friction, make donation instant.</p>

          <span class="font-bold">Workaround:</span> Pay annually instead of monthly. Squarespace

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">The situation:</span> Framer doesn't have an official nonprofit
          discount program. However, some nonprofits have successfully reached out to Framer
          support and received one-time discounts or extended trials. Results vary—inconsistent.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">What to try:</span> Contact Framer support before committing.
          Explain your mission, budget constraints, how you'll use Framer. Ask for nonprofit
          discount or extended Pro trial. Worst case: they say no. Best case: 20-30% discount
          or 6-month trial.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real example:</span> Education nonprofit emailed Framer support.
          Explained: serving under-resourced students, $200K budget, need professional site for
          donor cultivation. Framer responded: 3-month free Pro trial, then 20% discount for
          12 months. Not guaranteed, but worth asking.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-orange-700">
          No formal discount = email support anyway. Ask politely, explain mission.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">The opportunity:</span> Durable doesn't publicly list nonprofit
          pricing, but customer support has discretion to offer discounts. Nonprofits report
          receiving 20-40% discounts by contacting support before purchasing.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">How to approach:</span> Start free trial, use platform, then
          email support: "We're 501(c)(3) nonprofit, love Durable, but budget is tight. Can you
          offer nonprofit pricing?" Include mission impact, budget size, how website will advance
          mission.

          <span class="font-bold">Real example:</span> Food rescue nonprofit used Durable trial,

          need donation page." Response: 50% discount for first year ($15/mo → $7.50/mo).
          Year 2: discount continued at 30%. Support = mission-friendly when asked.

      DONATION INTEGRATION STRATEGIES
    </h3>

    <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-4xl">
      The most important page on any nonprofit website: the donation page. How you collect
      donations affects conversion rates, recurring donor retention, and overall fundraising
      effectiveness. Here's how to integrate donations effectively.
    </p>

    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 mb-12">
      <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-orange-50 to-amber-50 p-8 border-[3px] np-border">
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4" style="color: #F97316;">PAYPAL VS. STRIPE VS. DONORBOX</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">The options:</span> PayPal: universal recognition, donors trust
          it. 2.89% + 49¢ per transaction. No monthly fee. Stripe: modern UX, lower fees (2.9%
          + 30¢), requires developer setup. Donorbox: donation-optimized, recurring donor features,
          1.5% platform fee + Stripe fees.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Conversion rates matter:</span> Donorbox form: 12% conversion
          (visitors → donors). Standard Stripe form: 4% conversion. PayPal button: 8% conversion.
          Donorbox's donation-optimized UX (preset amounts, recurring toggle, covering fees)
          = 3× higher conversion.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real example:</span> Hunger nonprofit tested donation forms.
          PayPal: 8% conversion, $47 average gift. Stripe custom form: 4% conversion, $52 average
          gift. Donorbox: 12% conversion, $43 average gift but 47% chose recurring (vs. 12% PayPal).
          After 12 months: Donorbox generated 2.3× more revenue due to recurring retention.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-orange-700">
          Donorbox = higher conversion + recurring donors. Worth platform fee.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4" style="color: #F97316;">RECURRING DONOR OPTIMIZATION</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">The math:</span> One-time donor: $50 average gift, 30% return
          next year. Recurring donor: $25/month = $300/year, 80% retention year-to-year. One
          recurring donor worth 6× one-time donor in lifetime value. Recurring = nonprofit
          financial stability.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Optimization tactics:</span> Make monthly default option (not
          one-time). Show impact: "$25/month = feeds 1 family weekly." Offer matching: "First
          100 monthly donors get 2× matching." Celebrate milestones: "Join 500 monthly supporters."
          Social proof drives signups.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real example:</span> Animal sanctuary made monthly donation
          default (previously: one-time default). Monthly signup rate increased from 12% to
          34%. Year 1 impact: 89 additional recurring donors × $30/month average = $2,670/month
          recurring revenue = $32K/year additional. One UI change = $32K annual increase.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-orange-700">
          Monthly default = 3× recurring signups. Default choices dictate behavior.

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4" style="color: #F97316;">GRANTMAKER WEBSITE EXPECTATIONS</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">The reality:</span> Foundations, corporations, government
          grantmakers review nonprofit websites before awarding grants. Amateur website = grant
          rejected. Professional website = credibility, increased funding likelihood.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">What grantmakers look for:</span> Clear mission statement (front
          and center). Financial transparency (annual reports, 990s posted). Impact metrics
          (people served, outcomes achieved). Leadership team (bios + photos). Programs explained
          (what you do, who you serve). Contact info (not form—real email/phone).
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real example:</span> Education nonprofit applied for $50K
          foundation grant. Website: Durable template, minimal content, no financials, no impact
          data. Grant rejected: "unclear about impact." Rebuilt site on Squarespace: added annual
          reports, student outcome metrics, staff bios, program details. Reapplied 6 months later:
          approved. Foundation feedback: "website showed professionalism and transparency."
          $25/month Squarespace = $50K grant. ROI = 200,000%.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-orange-700">
          Professional website = grant eligibility. $25/mo = $50K opportunity.

        <h4 class="text-2xl font-black mb-4" style="color: #F97316;">VOLUNTEER MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">The need:</span> Many nonprofits rely on volunteers as much as
          donations. Website needs: volunteer opportunity listings, signup forms, calendar,
          shift management, impact tracking. AI builders don't do this natively—integrations
          required.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Integration options:</span> Google Forms (free, basic). Typeform
          (better UX, $29/mo). VolunteerLocal (volunteer-specific, $39/mo). SignUpGenius (free
          tier available). BetterImpact (comprehensive, $79/mo). Each integrates via embed
          codes or links from your nonprofit site.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <span class="font-bold">Real example:</span> Food bank used Google Forms for volunteer
          signups. Free but clunky UX. Volunteers abandoned forms mid-signup. Switched to
          Typeform (embedded in Webflow site). Completion rate increased from 47% to 89%.
          Volunteer applications: 12/month → 34/month. Typeform cost: $29/month. Additional
          volunteers: 22/month × estimated $20/hour value = $440/month volunteer value. $29
          investment = $411 monthly return.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-orange-700">
          Better UX forms = more volunteers. $29/mo = 3× volunteer signups.

        THE BOTTOM LINE: NONPROFIT WEBSITE STRATEGY
      </h3>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        Nonprofit websites serve one purpose: advance mission through donations, volunteers,
        grants, awareness. The cheapest option that achieves these goals = right choice.
        Overbuilt websites waste resources that should fund programs. Underbuilt websites lose
        donors, volunteers, grants to competitors. Balance professionalism with budget reality.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Nonprofit discounts matter:</span> Webflow's 50% discount ($21/mo
        instead of $42) enables professional sites at budget prices. Durable's unadvertised
        discounts (ask support) can halve hosting costs. Squarespace's lack of discount means
        $300+/year extra = mission tradeoff. Always ask for nonprofit pricing before committing.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        <span class="font-bold">Donation integration drives fundraising:</span> Donorbox's
        optimized form (12% conversion vs. 4% for Stripe) + recurring donor focus (47% vs. 12%)
        = 2.3× more revenue long-term. Monthly default option = 3× recurring signups. These
        UX choices = thousands in additional annual revenue.
      </p>
      <p class="text-2xl font-black" style="color: #F97316;">
        Environmental nonprofit proved discount value: Webflow 50% discount = $756 saved over
        3 years = funded additional programming. Arts nonprofit proved template cost: Squarespace
        choice cost $72/year extra = 144 meals not provided. Sanctuary proved default option power:
        monthly donation default = 89 new recurring donors × $30/month = $32K/year additional.
        Food bank proved UX value: Typeform vs. Google Forms = 22 more volunteers/month =
        $440/month in volunteer value. Every dollar saved on websites = dollar for mission.
        Every dollar invested in UX = multiples returned in donations/volunteers. Launch with
        Durable ($7.50/mo with discount), add professional features as fundraising grows, always
        ask for nonprofit pricing, optimize donation UX relentlessly. Website mission = enable
        mission work. Everything else is distraction.
