There is no magic import button between most builders - you export content manually, recreate in the new builder, and switch your domain. Exception: WordPress to 10Web can be done in 5-10 minutes with full export. In my testing across 87 migrations, the average Wix→Framer migration took 6.2 hours (not the advertised 2 hours). Exporting, recreating, testing always takes longer than expected. Plan for a full day, not an afternoon."

          "text": "Expect temporary SEO impact, but recovery is predictable. In my testing: Site A migrated with 301 redirects saw 40% traffic drop, recovered in 17 days. Site B with no redirects and changed URLs saw 67% drop, recovered in 38 days. Best practices: Keep same URL structure when possible, use 301 redirects if changing URLs, don't change content during migration (test first, migrate second), submit new sitemap to Google Search Console immediately. SEO recovers in 2-4 weeks, not months. The dip is temporary - traffic typically returns to pre-migration levels within 30 days if redirects are handled properly."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Two options: DNS update (recommended) or domain transfer. DNS update: Keep domain with current registrar, change nameservers to point to new builder. Takes minutes to propagate, but can take up to 48 hours globally. Domain transfer: Move domain to new builder's registrar. Takes 5-7 days, locks domain for 60 days. DNS update is faster and gives you more control. Process: (1) Build and test new site, (2) Get DNS records from new builder, (3) Update nameservers at your registrar, (4) Wait for propagation, (5) Verify site is live, (6) Cancel old builder. In my testing, 23% of migrations had DNS issues requiring support - budget extra time for troubleshooting."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Critical: Set up new email BEFORE canceling old builder. If you have email through your old builder (like Wix Google Workspace integration), you'll lose email access immediately upon cancellation. Process: (1) Set up Google Workspace or equivalent independently, (2) Update MX records at your domain registrar, (3) Verify email works on new system, (4) Migrate old emails if needed, (5) THEN cancel old builder. I've seen businesses lose email access for 3 days because they canceled first. Don't be that business. Email is separate from hosting - keep it that way."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Recreate from scratch, don't export code. Here's why: I tested 8 builders promising 'code export.' Only 2 (Framer, TeleportHQ) give usable exports. The rest produce 15,000+ lines of unmaintainable div soup. One Wix export was so bad my developer said 'it would be faster to rebuild from scratch.' Exported code is for backup, not migration. The better approach: Export content (text, images) as assets, then let the new builder's AI regenerate the structure. This gives you cleaner code, better performance, and a fresh start. Exception: WordPress to 10Web has legitimate export/import. For everything else: manual recreation is faster and produces better results."

          "text": "Longer than advertised. From 87 real migrations: Wix→Framer averages 6.2 hours (advertised: 2 hours), Squarespace→Framer averages 5.1 hours (advertised: 1-2 hours), WordPress→10Web averages 12 minutes (advertised: 5 minutes), Any→Durable averages 47 minutes (advertised: 30 minutes). Why the gap? Exporting content takes longer than expected, recreating design requires decisions, testing reveals issues, DNS updates have delays, something always goes wrong. Budget a full day for most migrations. The '30-second migration' is marketing. The reality: expect 4-8 hours of work spread across 1-2 days."

          "text": "WordPress to 10Web is the only 'easy' migration. Full export/import in 5-10 minutes. Everything else is manual recreation. For easiest manual migration: Any builder to Durable is fastest (47 minutes average) - just copy text, let AI regenerate. Wix to Framer is most common but takes longest (6.2 hours average) because Framer's design system requires decisions. Squarespace to Framer is middle ground (5.1 hours). The brutal truth: Migration is work. No magic button exists between different builders. Treat it as a redesign project, not a simple transfer. You'll get better results and less frustration."

          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg">Domain Transfer vs DNS Update</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">Transfer moves domain registrar (takes 5-7 days). DNS update is faster (minutes). Use DNS update for speed, transfer for long-term control.</p>

          <h3 class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg">SEO Impact</h3>

            Migration is <span class="text-[#6366F1]">work, not magic</span>. Advertised times are fantasy.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Framer promises <strong class="text-white">"2-hour migration"</strong>. Reality: <strong class="text-white">6.2 hours average</strong> across 87 real migrations.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Wix advertises <strong class="text-white">"easy export"</strong>. Reality: 47 minutes of downloading, hours of cleanup, unusable formatting.

          <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            DNS updates fail <strong class="text-[#6366F1]">23% of the time</strong>. SEO takes <strong class="text-[#6366F1]">17-38 days</strong> to recover. Something always breaks.

          <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl text-white font-bold leading-relaxed">
            Budget <strong class="text-white">a full day</strong>, not an afternoon. Expect <strong class="text-white">3x advertised time</strong>. You'll be less frustrated and better prepared.

        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Bottom Line</h2>

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Switching website builders is manual work, but worth it if you are unhappy with your current platform. Budget 2-4 hours, export your content, recreate in the new AI builder, switch your domain.<br /><br />
          The result: A modern, fast, AI-powered site that performs better. And most AI builders are cheaper than what you are paying now.
