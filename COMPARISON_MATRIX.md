**Current State:**
- "Planning phase" forever
- Reading about builders, not testing
- Comparison paralysis
- No reviews written
- $0 revenue

**Reality:**

- Testing > theorizing

# Framer Review 2025: Is It Worth It?

I spent 30 minutes testing Framer. Here's what I found.

## What Works

The drag-and-drop is incredibly smooth. I built a landing page
in 10 minutes without watching any tutorials.

Templates are modern and professional. The "SaaS Starter" template
looks like something that would cost $5K to have designed.

## What Sucks

The free tier is limited to 2 projects. That's it.

Custom CSS is... possible but not intuitive. If you want full control
over styling, you'll hit limits.

Exporting to HTML requires a paid plan. You can publish to Framer's
hosting for free, but if you want self-hosting, you pay.

## Best For

Framer is perfect for:
- Designers who want visual control
- Marketing landing pages
- Quick prototypes
- SaaS product sites

Framer is NOT for:
- Complex applications
- E-commerce with many products
- Blogs (use a CMS instead)
- Developers who want full code access

## Pricing

Free: 2 projects, Framer branding
Pro: $15/month, unlimited projects
Enterprise: Custom pricing

## Verdict

⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ 4/5 stars

**Would I recommend it?** Yes, for marketing sites.

For my use case (AI tool reviews), Framer is overkill. I'd use
it for landing pages but write the blog content in a proper CMS.

## Troubleshooting

### No Affiliate Program

**Problem:** Builder doesn't have affiliate program

**Solution:**
- Review anyway (builds authority)
- Link to alternatives that DO have programs
- Use display ads (Ezoic, Mediavine)

### Low Traffic

**Problem:** Reviews published but no traffic

**Solution:**
- SEO takes 3-6 months
- Promote on social media
- Guest post on design blogs
- Create comparison: "Framer vs Webflow"
- Build backlinks (comment on "[Builder] tutorials")

### No Sales

**Problem:** Traffic but no affiliate conversions

**Solution:**
- Make affiliate links more prominent
- Add CTAs: "Try [Builder] free"
- Write comparison: "Why I switched to [Builder]"
- Show screenshots of your builds
- Include video walkthrough

---

## Remember

> "One tested review is worth 100 untested comparisons."

**Pick ONE builder. Test it TODAY.**

**Not "I'll test all of them."**
**Not "I need to research more."**
**Not "I'm not ready."**

**Test ONE. Write the review. Publish it.**

**Time needed:** 30 minutes to test, 1 hour to write review

**Blocking:** All review revenue. Untested = no review = no revenue.
