How I lost a client by choosing the wrong AI builder—and what I learned about speed, lock-in, and the real cost of "good enough."

It was 2 AM on a Tuesday. I'd been on Zoom calls for 8 hours, staring at a blank Figma canvas, watching the cursor blink at me like it was judging my life choices.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
The client email was still open in another tab:
</p> <blockquote class="bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-[#F5521A] p-6 my-8 italic">
"We need a landing page by Friday. Budget is $8,000. Can you do it?"<br> <span class="text-gray-500 not-italic text-sm">— Sent 6 hours ago</span> </blockquote> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
I should've said yes. $8,000 for a landing page is good money. But I was tired. My brain was fried. And that's when I saw the ad:
</p> <blockquote class="bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-50 to-red-50 border-l-4 border-[#F5521A] p-6 my-8"> <strong class="text-gray-900">"Build your website in 30 seconds with AI. No design skills needed."</strong><br> <span class="text-gray-600 text-sm">Durable AI advertisement</span> </blockquote> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
30 seconds. I had 8 hours until my next meeting. Even with coffee, I wasn't designing a landing page from scratch in 8 hours.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
I clicked. I entered "SaaS landing page for project management tool" as my prompt. I hit generate.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
28 seconds later, I had a website. It wasn't great. The colors were weird. The copy said "Streamline your workflow" three times in one paragraph. But it was <strong>done</strong>.
</p> <div class="bg-red-50 border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6 my-8"> <p class="text-sm text-red-900 font-medium"> <strong>THE MISTAKE:</strong> I thought "done" meant "finished." It didn't. It meant "started," but I wouldn't realize that until $47,000 later.

I showed the client the site on Thursday. They <em>loved</em> it.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
"This is exactly what we wanted," Sarah said. She was the founder's COO, practical and no-nonsense. "How fast can you make it live?"
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
"Tonight," I said. And I meant it. I changed the logo. Updated the colors to match their brand. Rewrote the worst of the AI-generated copy. Clicked publish.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Sarah was thrilled. The founder was thrilled. I sent the invoice: $8,000. They paid immediately.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"> <strong>I was a genius.</strong> AI had just made me $8,000 in 48 hours. This was the future.
</p> <div class="bg-green-50 border-[3px] border-green-300 p-6 my-8"> <p class="text-sm text-green-900 font-medium"> <strong>WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW:</strong> The project wasn't finished. It had just started. And the tool I'd chosen couldn't go where we needed to go.
</p> </div> </section> <!-- CHAPTER 3: THE REQUESTS --> <section class="mb-16"> <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-6"> <span class="text-4xl font-black text-gray-200">03</span> <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-gray-900">The Requests: Simple Things Got Complicated</h2> </div> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Week 2: "Can we add a pricing table?"<br> <span class="text-gray-500">Me: "Sure!" (Takes 3 hours to hack together in their limited editor)</span> </p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Week 3: "The mobile view looks weird on iPhone 14." <br> <span class="text-gray-500">Me: "I'll fix it." (Spends 6 hours fighting with locked templates)</span> </p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Week 4: "Can we add a blog section?"<br> <span class="text-gray-500">Me: "Absolutely!" (Realizes there's no CMS. Has to manually build each blog post as a new page. Spends 12 hours building 3 posts.)</span> </p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Week 6: "We need to add customer case studies. Can you make them look like [competitor site]?"<br> <span class="text-gray-500">Me: "..." (Stares at their template editor. Can't do it. The layout is locked. The components are fixed. I'm trapped.)</span> </p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Each request added hours. Each "simple change" required workarounds. I was spending more time fighting the tool than I would've spent just building in Framer or Webflow from the start.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 font-bold text-gray-900">
But I was already $8,000 in. Switching meant admitting I chose wrong.
</p> </section> <!-- CHAPTER 4: THE ASK --> <section class="mb-16"> <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-6"> <span class="text-4xl font-black text-gray-200">04</span> <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-gray-900">The Ask: "We Need More"</h2> </div> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Month 2: Sarah calls me. "The landing page is working. We're getting leads. The founders want to expand."
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
"Great!" I said. Already mentally calculating the billable hours.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
"Here's what we need," she said. And then she listed it:
</p> <ul class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-3"> <li class="flex items-start gap-3"> <span class="text-[#F5521A] font-black">1.</span> <span>Full website (15 pages minimum)</span> </li> <li class="flex items-start gap-3"> <span class="text-[#F5521A] font-black">2.</span> <span>Customer portal (login, dashboard, support tickets)</span> </li> <li class="flex items-start gap-3"> <span class="text-[#F5521A] font-black">3.</span> <span>Integration with their CRM (HubSpot)</span> </li> <li class="flex items-start gap-3"> <span class="text-[#F5521A] font-black">4.</span> <span>Blog with CMS (they want to post 3x/week)</span> </li> <li class="flex items-start gap-3"> <span class="text-[#F5521A] font-black">5.</span> <span>E-commerce (they're adding paid plans)</span> </li> </ul> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
I listened. I nodded. I said "Of course, I can scope this."
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Inside, I was sweating. The tool I'd built their landing page on <strong>could not do any of this</strong>. No portals. No real integrations. No CMS. No e-commerce beyond a Stripe button.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
I had to migrate everything. Rebuild from scratch. In a new tool.
</p> <div class="bg-red-50 border-[3px] border-red-300 p-6 my-8"> <p class="text-sm text-red-900 font-medium"> <strong>THE REALIZATION:</strong> My $8,000 "quick win" just became a $39,000 migration project. Because I chose for speed, not scalability.
</p> </div> </section> <!-- CHAPTER 5: THE MIGRATION --> <section class="mb-16"> <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-6"> <span class="text-4xl font-black text-gray-200">05</span> <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-gray-900">The Migration: 6 Weeks of Hell</h2> </div> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
I proposed a migration to Webflow. "We need to rebuild from scratch to support what you're building," I explained. "It'll take 6 weeks. $39,000."
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Sarah approved it. But I could hear the hesitation in her voice.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
"I don't understand," she said. "I thought we were done? Why do we need to rebuild?"
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
"We outgrew the tool," I said. Which was true. But what I didn't say was: <strong>I chose the wrong tool from the start.</strong> </p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
The next 6 weeks were brutal. I had to:
</p> <ul class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-3"> <li class="flex items-start gap-3"> <span class="text-red-600">✗</span> <span>Manually recreate every page (copy-paste from Durable to Webflow)</span> </li> <li class="flex items-start gap-3"> <span class="text-red-600">✗</span> <span>Redesign components that were locked in Durable's templates</span> </li> <li class="flex items-start gap-3"> <span class="text-red-600">✗</span> <span>Rebuild forms from scratch (Durable's forms wouldn't export)</span> </li> <li class="flex items-start gap-3"> <span class="text-red-600">✗</span> <span>Fix responsive issues that Durable hid with its rigid templates</span> </li> </ul> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
6 weeks. $39,000. And the whole time, I'm wondering: <strong>Why didn't I just use Webflow from the start?</strong> </p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
I would've been done in 4 weeks. For $25,000. Instead, I spent 10 weeks total and charged them $47,000 for work that should've cost half that.
</p> </section> <!-- CHAPTER 6: THE END --> <section class="mb-16"> <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-6"> <span class="text-4xl font-black text-gray-200">06</span> <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-gray-900">The End: They Didn't Renew</h2> </div> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
We launched the full site in month 4. It was beautiful. Webflow let me do everything they wanted. The client was happy.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Sort of.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Month 6: Contract renewal time. I sent the proposal: $5,000/month for ongoing maintenance and updates.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Sarah called me. "We love the site," she said. "But we're hiring an in-house person. They'll handle updates."
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
I understood. They'd spent $47,000 with me. For that money, they could hire someone full-time for months.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
But I also knew the real reason: <strong>They didn't trust me anymore.</strong> </p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
I'd saved time upfront by choosing the wrong tool. Then I charged them to fix my mistake. They paid, but they noticed.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
$47,000 revenue. Zero recurring revenue. A client who won't recommend me.
</p> <div class="bg-gray-900 p-6 my-8 text-white"> <p class="text-sm mb-4"> <strong class="text-[#F5521A]">THE REAL COST:</strong> </p> <p class="text-sm">
If I'd chosen the right tool from the start:<br>
• Project cost: $25,000 (not $47,000)<br>
• Timeline: 4 weeks (not 10 weeks)<br>

Speed is a trap if it limits your future</p> <p class="text-sm opacity-90">Durable was fast. But it couldn't grow with the client. I paid for that speed later—22x more than I saved.</p> </div> <div> <p class="font-black text-lg mb-2">2. "Good enough" is rarely good enough</p> <p class="text-sm opacity-90">The landing page worked. But as soon as they needed more, the tool failed. Plan for growth, not just launch.</p> </div> <div> <p class="font-black text-lg mb-2">3. Vendor lock-in has a real cost</p> <p class="text-sm opacity-90">I couldn't export the site properly. Couldn't scale. Had to rebuild everything. That's not "saving time"—that's borrowing time you'll pay back with interest.</p> </div> <div> <p class="font-black text-lg mb-2">4. Clients pay for outcomes, not your tools</p> <p class="text-sm opacity-90">They didn't care I used AI. They cared that it couldn't do what they needed next. Choose tools that can go the distance.</p> </div> <div> <p class="font-black text-lg mb-2">5. Admit mistakes early</p> <p class="text-sm opacity-90">If I'd said "I chose wrong" in week 2, migration would've cost $15,000. By week 8, it was $39,000. Delay costs money.</p> </div> </div> </section> <!-- THE FRAMEWORK --> <section class="mb-16"> <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-6">My New Framework for Choosing AI Builders</h2> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
After this disaster, I stopped thinking about "fastest" and started thinking about "fit." Here's the framework I use now:
</p> <div class="space-y-4"> <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 border-l-4 border-green-500"> <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">QUESTION 1: What will this site need in 6 months?</p> <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">If you can't answer this, don't launch. AI builders that can't scale will cost you 10x when you need to migrate.</p> </div> <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 border-l-4 border-blue-500"> <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">QUESTION 2: Can I export the code?</p> <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">If not, you're locked in. Lock-in is fine if you're sure. Deadly if you're guessing.</p> </div> <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 border-l-4 border-purple-500"> <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">QUESTION 3: What happens when they want X?</p> <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">X = CMS, E-commerce, Portal, Integrations. If your tool can't do it, you'll be rebuilding.</p> </div> <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 border-l-4 border-orange-500"> <p class="font-black text-gray-900 mb-2">QUESTION 4: Am I choosing for me or for them?</p> <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">Durable was fast for ME. But it couldn't do what THEY needed. That's the wrong choice.</p> </div> </div> </section> <!-- FINAL THOUGHTS --> <section class="mb-16"> <h2 class="text-2xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-6">So... Should You Use AI Builders?</h2> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
Yes. But not for everything.
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"> <strong>Durable AI</strong> is still my go-to for:
</p> <ul class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-2"> <li>• MVPs and landing pages (when speed matters more than anything)</li> <li>• Local businesses that will never need more than 5 pages</li> <li>• Testing ideas before committing to custom build</li> </ul> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6"> <strong>But I'll never make the same mistake again.</strong> Now I ask: "What happens when this works?" Because <em>of course</em> it's going to work. And then they'll want more. And your tool needs to be ready for "more."
</p> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
$47,000 is an expensive lesson. But it's one I'll never forget.
