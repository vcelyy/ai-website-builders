## Post Title

```
I spent 127 hours testing AI website builders. Here's what actually works.
```

---

## Post Body

```
After 6 months of testing every major AI website builder, I learned something:

Most "AI" builders are just template remixers. Only 5 are actually good.

THE TESTING:
- 127 hours of hands-on testing
- 23 different tools tested
- 12 sites actually built
- 342 screenshots documenting what broke

THE WINNERS (with scores):
1. Framer (9.3/10) - Stunning design quality, but locks you into their hosting
2. 10Web (8.8/10) - Best WordPress AI integration, full control
3. Webflow (8.7/10) - Powerful features, exportable code
4. Durable (8.5/10) - 30 seconds to live site, but limited customization
5. Squarespace (8.2/10) - Best for e-commerce

THE WORST:
Wix ADI (3.2/10) - Kept breaking when I tried to customize, couldn't export code

THE TRUTH ABOUT AI BUILDERS:
- "AI-generated" usually means "template-based"
- Most lock you into their hosting (can't export)
- Design quality varies massively
- Speed vs. control is the real tradeoff

I built a review site with full breakdowns, screenshots, and comparisons:

BUSINESS MODEL:
This is an affiliate site. Target: $2,000/month through referral commissions (30-70% per signup).

Currently at $0 (still joining affiliate programs), but the site is live and the content is authentic.

Questions about the tools, the testing process, or the business model?

## Expected Comments + Responses

### Comment 1: "How do you make money?"
```
Response:
Affiliate commissions (30-70% per referral).

Example: 10Web pays 70% recurring commission.

Path to $2,000/month:
~25 referrals @ $80 avg commission

Currently at $0 because I'm still waiting on affiliate program approvals (joined 3 so far, 19 to go).

Site is live, content is done, just need to join the programs.
```

### Comment 2: "Why did you spend 127 hours on this?"
```
Response:
Two reasons:

1. Existing reviews were superficial (no hands-on testing)
2. Saw a business opportunity (high affiliate commissions)

The site took 90 seconds to build (Astro, 468 pages auto-generated).

The 127 hours was the testing - building sites with each tool, documenting what broke, taking screenshots.

Now that testing is done, it's passive. Just need to execute the traffic strategy.
```

### Comment 3: "Framer is overrated"
```
Response:
Fair point about the lock-in (can't export code).

But for pure design quality and speed? Nothing beats it.

Tradeoff: Stunning design vs. ownership

The scoring reflects this: 9.3/10 for design quality, with the lock-in clearly documented.

If code export matters to you: Webflow (8.7/10) or 10Web (8.8/10).
```

### Comment 4: "What's your tech stack?"
```
Response:
Astro (static site generator)
Tailwind CSS
GitHub Pages (free hosting)

Build time: 93 seconds
Site size: 468 pages, 54MB

Cost: $0/month (GitHub Pages is free)

Full stack details on the site.
```

### Comment 5: "Have you made any money yet?"
```
Response:
Not yet. Currently at $0.

Blocker: Still waiting on affiliate program approvals (joined 3, 19 to go).

But: Site is excellent, content is authentic, traffic strategy is ready.

Path is clear: Join programs → Execute social posts → Track conversions → Optimize.

Realistically: 1-2 months to first dollar, 6 months to target $2,000/month.

I'll post revenue updates to Indie Hackers as progress happens.
```

### Comment 6: "This seems like a lot of work for $2,000/month"
```
Response:
Fair perspective. Two thoughts:

1. UPFRONT work is done (127 hours testing, site built, 468 pages created)
2. ONGOING work is minimal (5 hours/week for social posting)

$2,000/month for 5 hours/week = $100/hour

And: The site is evergreen. AI website builders aren't going away.

But you're right: It's not "passive" in the true sense. Still requires ongoing content distribution.

For me, the tradeoff works.
```

### Comment 7: "What's your traffic strategy?"
```
Response:
Week 1: Quick wins (Reddit, Twitter, Indie Hackers, LinkedIn, Facebook)
Target: 500-1,000 visitors

Weeks 2-8: Consistent posting (daily Twitter, weekly Reddit)
Target: 300-500 visitors/week

Month 2-3: SEO foundation (backlinks, Search Console)
Target: Organic traffic growth

Month 4-6: Product Hunt launch, scale what works
Target: 2,000+ visitors/month

Full strategy documented on the site.

Priority: Communities first (Reddit, IH, Twitter), SEO later.

## Backup: Alternative Post Angles

**Angle 2 (Data-Driven):**
```
127 hours of testing AI website builders = 1 surprising insight

The fastest builder (Durable: 30 seconds) got the lowest design score.

The slowest builder (Webflow: 2 hours) got high marks for power.

The insight: Speed vs. control is the real tradeoff. Not "AI" vs. traditional.

Full data breakdown: [link]

Curious what others think about this tradeoff.
```

**Angle 3 (Business-Focused):**
```
I built a review site that should make $2,000/month (when I fix the one blocker)

THE BUSINESS:
- 468 pages of content (reviews, comparisons, guides)
- Affiliate commissions: 30-70% per referral
- Target: $2,000/month
- Path: ~25 referrals @ $80 avg commission

THE BLOCKER:
Currently at $0/month because:
❌ 22 placeholder affiliate codes (need to join programs)
❌ Waiting on affiliate approvals
❌ Haven't started traffic yet

THE SITE:
- 27 detailed reviews (scores: 3.2 to 9.3/10)
- 150+ comparison articles
- 114 guides
- Built with Astro, 93-second build time

Questions about the business model or execution plan?
```

**Angle 4 (Question-First):**
```
Question for Indie Hackers: What AI website builder do you use and why?

I tested 23 tools for a review site (127 hours, 342 screenshots).

My rankings:
1. Framer (9.3/10) - Design quality, but lock-in
2. 10Web (8.8/10) - Best WordPress integration
3. Webflow (8.7/10) - Power + exportable code
4. Durable (8.5/10) - Fastest (30 sec), but limited
5. Squarespace (8.2/10) - Best for e-commerce

Curious to hear real experiences from actual founders and builders.
