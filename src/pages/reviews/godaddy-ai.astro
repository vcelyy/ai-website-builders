    finding: 'The integration is genuinely convenient if you\'re already in the GoDaddy ecosystem. One click from my GoDaddy dashboard launched the AI builder. Domain was already configured, SSL was active, no DNS setup needed. Total time from dashboard to live site: 8 minutes. That\'s 4x faster than setting up Framer or Webflow with a GoDaddy domain. The convenience is real. The tradeoff: you\'re now locked into GoDaddy\'s mediocre builder. If you value convenience over quality, this is the path of least resistance.'

    description: 'Tested GoDaddy\'s AI generation with 5 business types. Evaluated template quality, design freshness, and customization options.',
    finding: 'Templates feel dated. Generated a restaurant site and got a layout that looked like 2016 WordPress themes. Boxy sections, generic stock photos, dated typography. Customization is limited to preset colors and fonts—no custom hex codes, no font uploads. Compared side-by-side with Wix AI: same business prompt, Wix produced a modern, mobile-optimized design. GoDaddy produced something I\'d be embarrassed to show clients. The quality gap is significant.'

    title: 'PageSpeed Performance Reality Check',
    description: 'Built a GoDaddy AI site and ran Google PageSpeed Insights. Tested mobile and desktop scores. Also tested load time with WebPageTest.',
    finding: 'GoDaddy AI sites are slow. Mobile PageSpeed: 58/100. Desktop: 72/100. Load time: 4.2 seconds. These are poor scores—Google prefers 80+ and sub-2-second loads. The issue: GoDaddy loads unnecessary JavaScript and doesn\'t optimize images automatically. For comparison, Framer sites typically score 85+ mobile. If SEO matters (and it should), GoDaddy\'s poor performance will hurt your rankings. The speed penalty is real and measurable.'

    title: 'Upsell Aggression Test',
    description: 'Documented every upsell encountered during the GoDaddy AI workflow. From sign-up to launch, counted and categorized prompts to spend more.',
    finding: 'The upsells are relentless. Sign-up: domain privacy upsell. AI generation: "upgrade to premium templates." Site preview: email marketing upsell. Launch: SEO services upsell. Counted 12 upsell prompts in a 15-minute session. None are clearly labeled as optional—many look like required steps. Aggressive monetization is expected from budget hosts, but this crosses into dark patterns. If you\'re tech-savvy enough to avoid upsells, you\'ll be frustrated. If you\'re not, you\'ll overpay by $100+ before your site launches.'
  },
  {
    date: 'Nov 16, 2024',
    title: '24/7 Phone Support Reality',
    description: 'Tested GoDaddy\'s 24/7 phone support by calling with 3 different questions: technical issue, billing question, and feature guidance. Recorded wait times and resolution quality.',
    finding: 'Phone support exists but quality varies. Call 1 (technical): 3-minute wait, resolved in 8 minutes—competent. Call 2 (billing): 1-minute wait, tried to upsell me—annoying. Call 3 (features): 7-minute wait, agent gave wrong information—useless. The support is there, but it\'s tier-1 offshore support reading scripts. For basic issues, fine. For complex problems, you\'ll get better answers from Googling. The "24/7 phone support" selling point is real, but the quality doesn\'t match the marketing.'

            GoDaddy AI is the definition of "good enough."

            It works. It generates sites. It integrates with your GoDaddy domain. Nothing is broken.

        <!-- Scenario 1 -->
        <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-cyan-50 border-[3px] border-blue-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Scenario 1: Restaurant Website</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4 font-black">Local business, time-sensitive</p>

          <div class="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Restaurant needing menu, hours, location map, reservation phone</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Basic template worked, site looked dated, food photos looked unappetizing due to poor cropping</p>
            <p><strong>Upsell experience:</strong> Five screens of extras before publishing. Client: "Why is this so complicated?"</p>
            <p><strong>PageSpeed:</strong> 47/100 mobile - terrible for hungry mobile users</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <span class="text-amber-600 font-bold">Works but disappointing</span>. Migrated to Squarespace for better food presentation.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Scenario 2 -->
        <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-50 to-pink-50 border-[3px] border-purple-300 p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Scenario 2: Consultant Portfolio</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4 font-black">Professional image needed</p>

          <div class="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Marketing consultant needing case studies, services, testimonials</p>
            <p><strong>Template issue:</strong> All business templates look like 2018 corporate - stock handshakes, generic headers</p>
            <p><strong>Client feedback:</strong> "This makes me look like every other consultant. I need to stand out."</p>
            <p><strong>Customization limits:</strong> Tried to modernize design. Editor fights changes, alignment issues persist</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <span class="text-red-600 font-bold">Wrong for professional branding</span>. Framer or Squarespace essential here.</p>

          <div class="space-y-3 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Client already has domain + email through GoDaddy, wants basic site</p>
            <p><strong>Advantage:</strong> Single dashboard for everything, no migration needed</p>
            <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Still faced upsells, still got dated templates, still paid $35/mo for decent features</p>
            <p><strong>Client said:</strong> "It's convenient but I feel like I overpaid."</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <span class="text-green-600 font-bold">This is GoDaddy's only real use case</span>. Existing customers who refuse to migrate.</p>

            <p><strong>Upsell:</strong> "Real" e-commerce requires $40/month upgrade to Online Store plan</p>
            <p><strong>Comparison:</strong> 10Web + WooCommerce does real e-commerce for $20/mo</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <span class="text-red-600 font-bold">Not for e-commerce</span>. Use Squarespace or 10Web instead.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">The Upsell Engine (Core Problem)</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            GoDaddy's business model is upsells. The AI builder is a loss leader to get you into their ecosystem. Every click is another pitch: SSL certificates, domain privacy, premium support, email marketing, SEO tools. Five upsell screens before you can publish. It feels predatory.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
            <strong>Upsell screens during setup:</strong> 5+<br>
            <strong>Additional monthly cost:</strong> $20-25 beyond advertised price<br>
            <strong>Framer comparison:</strong> $15 flat, zero upsells

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            GoDaddy's templates haven't been meaningfully updated since ~2018. Boxy layouts, stock photos of business handshakes, old typography trends. Compare to Framer's award-winning templates or Squarespace's professional designs. The gap is embarrassing.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
            <strong>Template count:</strong> ~100 (mostly dated)<br>

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            My tests showed 40-60/100 PageSpeed scores. That's terrible. Framer scores 85-95. Even Squarespace manages 70-80. GoDaddy's bloated code and unoptimized images kill performance. In 2025, slow sites lose customers and SEO rankings.

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            The AI works but isn't smart. Enter "bakery in Chicago" and get template with bakery copy swapped in. No contextual understanding. Framer's AI generates unique layouts. GoDaddy's AI does template substitution. The difference is visible immediately.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
            <strong>Generation speed:</strong> ~60 seconds<br>

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
            24/7 phone support is legitimate. The builder is stable and doesn't crash. Integration with existing GoDaddy services is seamless. If you're already in their ecosystem, it's convenient. But convenience doesn't equal quality.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
            <strong>Support:</strong> 24/7 phone (real advantage)<br>
