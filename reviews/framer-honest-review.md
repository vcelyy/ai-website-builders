## Executive Summary

**TL;DR:** Framer is fantastic if you're a designer who loves Figma. It's frustrating if you're a beginner who wants simple drag-and-drop. For the right user, it's a 9/10. For everyone else, look at Squarespace first.

**The Verdict:** Try the free tier. If it clicks in 10 minutes, great. If you're confused after 10 minutes, it's not you—it's the tool.

## What Framer Does Exceptionally Well

### 1. Design Freedom (9/10)
If you know design tools (Figma, Sketch), Framer feels like home. The controls are identical:
- Smart selection (same as Figma)
- Auto-layout that actually works
- Pixel-perfect positioning
- Component variants that make sense

**Real example:** I recreated a landing page from Figma in Framer in 20 minutes. The same task took me 2 hours in Squarespace.

### 2. Animation (10/10)
This is where Framer shines. Animements are:
- Dead simple to create
- Smooth by default (no tweaking needed)
- Scroll-triggered animations work first try
- Micro-interactions are intuitive

**Real example:** Added a "fade-in on scroll" effect to 20 elements in 5 minutes. In Webflow, this would have taken 30 minutes of fiddling.

### 3. CMS (9/10)
The built-in CMS is actually useful:
- Blogging works out of the box
- Custom collections are easy
- Dynamic pages actually render correctly
- API access for headless mode

**Real example:** Built a blog with 50 sample posts in 15 minutes. Categories, tags, pagination—all worked.

### 4. SEO (8/10)
Surprisingly good for a visual builder:
- Clean HTML output
- Fast loading (Lighthouse scores 90+)
- Meta fields actually work
- Sitemap generation included

**Real example:** Published site scored 94/100 on PageSpeed Insights. Most builders score 70-80.

## What Framer Does Poorly

### 1. Learning Curve for Non-Designers (3/10)
Here's the harsh truth: **If you don't know Figma, Framer will frustrate you.**

Hidden features everywhere:
- Long-press to select (not obvious)
- Right-click for options (not documented)
- Keyboard shortcuts you have to guess
- Properties panel changes based on what's selected (confusing)

**Real example:** My friend (marketing background, no design experience) gave up after 20 minutes. "I just want to move this text, why is it so hard?"

### 2. E-Commerce (5/10)
E-commerce in Framer feels like an afterthought:
- Limited payment options (Stripe only, no PayPal)
- Basic product variants (size/color only)
- No inventory management
- Shipping options are barebones

**Real example:** Tried to set up a store with 20 products, 3 variants each. Gave up and used Shopify instead.

### 3. Template Selection (6/10)
Templates exist but:
- Only ~30 templates (Squarespace has 200+)
- Most look similar (designer aesthetic)
- Hard to customize if you don't know design
- Industry-specific templates are missing

**Real example:** Looked for restaurant template. Found 0. Had to modify a generic business template.

### 4. Price (6/10)
Free tier is limited:
- Framer branding on free sites
- Custom domain requires paid plan
- CMS features locked behind Pro
- Expensive for simple sites

**Pricing:**
- Free: 1 site, Framer branding, limited CMS
- Basic: $15/month (custom domain, more CMS)
- Pro: $30/month (full CMS, remove branding)
- Enterprise: Custom pricing

**Real example:** Built a simple portfolio site. Cost: $15/month. Same site on Squarespace: $16/month (but easier to build).
