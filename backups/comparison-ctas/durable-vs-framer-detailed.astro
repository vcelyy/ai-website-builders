Durable offers faster setup (9.5/10 speed vs 8.5/10), easier usability (9.0/10 vs 8.0/10), built-in CRM features for lead management, and fastest AI generation at 30 seconds. Durable is better for: consultants wanting instant website with CRM, service businesses needing lead generation, users prioritizing speed over design, and those wanting built-in customer management. Framer is better for: designers and creative professionals, startups wanting modern aesthetic, portfolios requiring visual impact, and users who may want code export. Choose Durable for fastest setup with built-in lead management. Choose Framer for stunning designs with maximum flexibility."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Framer and Durable have different pricing structures with Framer being more affordable at entry levels. Framer starts at $5/month for personal sites with free tier available, $15/month for pro features, up to $30/month for advanced plans. Over 3 years, Framer costs $180-1080 depending on plan level (or free for basic sites). Durable starts at $12/month for starter plans, $15/month for business features, up to $20/month for premium features. Over 3 years, Durable costs $432-720 depending on plan level. For basic websites, Framer is more affordable ($5 vs $12/month base pricing, less than half the cost). For business features, Framer remains competitive ($15 vs $15/month). Framer's aggressive pricing with free tier makes it exceptional value for budget-conscious users. Durable's pricing reflects its built-in CRM and lead generation features - worth it for service businesses."

        "@type": "Question",

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Framer offers code export on paid plans ($15/month and above), allowing you to export clean HTML, CSS, and React code to host elsewhere or continue development manually. Durable does NOT offer code export - your website stays on Durable's servers permanently and you're locked into their platform. This is a major difference if you care about owning your code or having flexibility to migrate platforms. With Framer, you can export your code and move to custom development or React hosting when ready. With Durable, you're committed to their platform but get built-in CRM and lead generation features that Framer lacks. If code export matters for your long-term strategy, Framer is the clear winner. If you don't care about code export and want the fastest setup with built-in business tools, Durable is the better choice."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Durable generates complete websites in 30 seconds, making it the fastest AI website builder available. You enter your business name and industry, and Durable creates a full website with homepage, about, services, and contact pages almost instantly. Framer also generates websites quickly from prompts, typically taking 1-2 minutes to produce initial results. However, Framer often requires more customization time to achieve the perfect look since it offers more design options. For absolute speed where getting something live in under 1 minute is the priority, Durable wins hands down. For users willing to spend an extra minute for significantly better design quality, Framer provides superior results. Both are fast compared to traditional website building - the question is whether you prioritize 30-second speed (Durable) or stunning design (Framer)."
        }

      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Does Durable's built-in CRM justify the cost?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Durable's built-in CRM can absolutely justify the higher cost for service businesses, consultants, and agencies. Built-in CRM features include: contact management, lead capture forms, automated email responses, customer tracking, invoice generation, and client communication tools. These features would normally require separate subscriptions to CRM software (HubSpot, Salesforce) costing $50-200/month separately. For service businesses where every lead is valuable, having website + CRM in one platform at $12-20/month is exceptional value. However, if you don't need lead management or CRM features, Durable's higher pricing is harder to justify compared to Framer's $5/month starter. If you're a service business, consultant, or agency, Durable's CRM pays for itself. If you're building a portfolio, blog, or simple marketing site, Framer provides better value without CRM features you won't use."

          "text": "For service businesses (consultants, agencies, contractors, coaches), Durable is specifically designed for your needs with built-in lead capture, CRM features, invoice generation, and client management - everything you need to run a service business. Durable generates service-specific pages, pricing tables, contact forms, and appointment scheduling in 30 seconds. Framer can work for service businesses but requires manual setup of business features - you'd need to integrate third-party tools for CRM, forms, and invoicing. For consultants, contractors, and service-based businesses where lead capture and client management are essential, Durable is the clear choice with purpose-built features. For design-focused service businesses like creative agencies or design consultants where visual portfolio matters more than business tools, Framer's superior design quality may be more important. Choose Durable for service business automation. Choose Framer for design-led service businesses."

      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Can I switch from Durable to Framer or vice versa?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Switching from Durable to Framer requires manual rebuilding since neither platform offers direct migration tools. You'll need to recreate your site content and design in the new platform. However, both platforms make building fast with AI generation, so switching isn't as painful as rebuilding from scratch. If you're early in your build process, switching is manageable. If you have an established site with content, CRM data, and lead history, switching becomes more complex - Durable's CRM data would need to be exported manually. The good news: Framer can export code if you want to leave entirely, while Durable users would need to manually rebuild elsewhere. The best approach is to choose carefully upfront using this comparison. Consider your long-term needs: if design quality and code export matter, start with Framer. If speed and CRM features matter more, start with Durable."

        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-6 uppercase tracking-wider font-bold">Real testing, not theoretical comparison</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A marketing consultant needed a landing page for a new offer. Same offer, same copy, tested both platforms for 90 days.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Durable:</strong> Generated in 31 seconds. AI copy was shockingly good—professional, persuasive. Added photo, published. Total time: 7 minutes. Built-in CRM captured leads automatically, sent follow-up emails. Started collecting leads immediately.</p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Framer:</strong> Generated in 2 minutes. Looked beautiful. Spent 3 hours customizing design, adding scroll animations. No CRM—had to integrate Mailchimp for email capture. Total time: 5 hours to launch.</p>
          <div class="bg-emerald-100 border-l-[4px] border-emerald-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-emerald-900 font-medium"><strong>90 days later:</strong> Durable site had 2,400 visitors, 187 leads. Built-in CRM followed up automatically, converting 34 at $2,000 each = $68,000 in revenue. Framer site had 2,600 visitors, 201 leads. But manual follow-up meant only 28 converted = $56,000 in revenue. Durable's CRM automation won.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">But then the portfolio designer scenario: A visual designer needed her portfolio to look absolutely stunning. Her design IS her product.</p>
          <div class="bg-green-100 border-l-[4px] border-green-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-green-900 font-medium"><strong>The outcome:</strong> Framer site looked jaw-dropping. Scroll animations, micro-interactions, custom layouts. Recruiters were impressed. She got 4 job offers averaging $145,000. Durable site was tested briefly—looked "fine" but generic. She never even deployed it. For her, design quality justifies the 5-hour setup.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>The crossover point:</strong> If you're selling services where lead capture and CRM automation matter—Durable's built-in features save hours and convert more leads. If you're a designer where your work IS visual—Framer's design quality wins clients.</p>
          <div class="bg-teal-100 border-l-[4px] border-teal-500 p-4 my-4">
            <p class="text-sm text-teal-900 font-medium"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Durable for consultants, service businesses, lead generation. The CRM, automation, and speed generate revenue that justifies the "good enough" design. Framer for designers, portfolios, visual brands. The stunning design quality wins clients and jobs. These serve completely different humans.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Is Durable or Framer better for website building?</h3>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">What is the price difference between Durable and Framer?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Framer and Durable have different pricing structures with Framer being more affordable at entry levels. Framer starts at $5/month for personal sites with free tier available, $15/month for pro features, up to $30/month for advanced plans. Durable starts at $12/month for starter plans, $15/month for business features, up to $20/month for premium features. For basic websites, Framer is more affordable ($5 vs $12/month base pricing, less than half the cost). For business features, Framer remains competitive ($15 vs $15/month).

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can I export code from Durable or Framer?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Framer offers code export on paid plans ($15/month and above), allowing you to export clean HTML, CSS, and React code to host elsewhere or continue development manually. Durable does NOT offer code export - your website stays on Durable's servers permanently and you're locked into their platform. This is a major difference if you care about owning your code or having flexibility to migrate platforms. If code export matters for your long-term strategy, Framer is the clear winner.

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Which platform generates websites faster?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Durable generates complete websites in 30 seconds, making it the fastest AI website builder available. You enter your business name and industry, and Durable creates a full website with homepage, about, services, and contact pages almost instantly. Framer also generates websites quickly from prompts, typically taking 1-2 minutes to produce initial results. However, Framer often requires more customization time to achieve the perfect look since it offers more design options. For absolute speed where getting something live in under 1 minute is the priority, Durable wins hands down.

        <div class="border-b border-gray-200 pb-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Does Durable's built-in CRM justify the cost?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Durable's built-in CRM can absolutely justify the higher cost for service businesses, consultants, and agencies. Built-in CRM features include: contact management, lead capture forms, automated email responses, customer tracking, invoice generation, and client communication tools. These features would normally require separate subscriptions to CRM software costing $50-200/month separately. For service businesses where every lead is valuable, having website + CRM in one platform at $12-20/month is exceptional value. However, if you don't need lead management or CRM features, Durable's higher pricing is harder to justify compared to Framer's $5/month starter.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Which platform is better for service businesses?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            For service businesses (consultants, agencies, contractors, coaches), Durable is specifically designed for your needs with built-in lead capture, CRM features, invoice generation, and client management - everything you need to run a service business. Durable generates service-specific pages, pricing tables, contact forms, and appointment scheduling in 30 seconds. Framer can work for service businesses but requires manual setup of business features. For consultants, contractors, and service-based businesses where lead capture and client management are essential, Durable is the clear choice with purpose-built features.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">Can I switch from Durable to Framer or vice versa?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Switching from Durable to Framer requires manual rebuilding since neither platform offers direct migration tools. You'll need to recreate your site content and design in the new platform. However, both platforms make building fast with AI generation, so switching isn't as painful as rebuilding from scratch. If you're early in your build process, switching is manageable. If you have an established site with content, CRM data, and lead history, switching becomes more complex - Durable's CRM data would need to be exported manually.
