        <p class="text-sm text-lime-600 font-black uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE PEST CONTROL WEBSITE PROBLEM</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Most pest control websites fail customers. Outdated design, buried pest services, vague pricing ("call for quote"), no emergency availability, licenses hidden, difficult quote forms, not mobile-optimized. Homeowner with ants in kitchen = panic = searches "pest control near me" on phone = visits 5 sites = calls first professional-looking site with visible ants service. Your outdated site = unprofessional = skip = competitor gets the call. Pest control = emergency service = immediate need = website creates first impression in 2 seconds = professional or amateur = trust or doubt.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="border-l-[3px] border-lime-500 pl-6 py-5 bg-lime-50/50 rounded-r mb-8">

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Marcus Green, Green's Pest Control in Cincinnati, family business 12 years, 3 technicians. Struggling to grow despite quality service. Website: basic template from 2018, buried services page, "contact for quote" only, no emergency mention, licenses not visible, quote form not mobile-friendly. Results: 24 service calls/month (mostly word-of-mouth), $48,000/month revenue, enough to survive but not grow. Competitors with better sites: 80+ calls/month. Losing emergency jobs (highest margin) because no 24/7 visible. Tried Yelp ads: expensive, low quality leads. The problem: not the service quality - the website looks unprofessional = customers doubt legitimacy = call competitor.</p>

      <div class="border-l-[3px] border-emerald-500 pl-6 py-5 bg-emerald-50/50 rounded-r mb-8">

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">I rebuilt his site with Squarespace AI in 2 days. New professional presence: clean modern design, "We Handle: Ants, Roaches, Bed Bugs, Termites, Rodents, Spiders, Mosquitoes" prominently on homepage, "24/7 Emergency Service Available" badge, "Treatment Starting At: Ants $99, Roaches $129, Bed Bugs $199" with transparent ranges, "Fully Licensed & Insured - State License #CIN-28475" visible, "Serving: Greater Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky, Southeast Indiana" with cities, mobile-optimized quote form, "Same Day Response" promise, before/after treatment photos. Squarespace delivered professional templates that build trust instantly, integrated contact forms that work perfectly on mobile, SSL security showing customers you're legitimate, blog for pest prevention tips. Cost: $39/month.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Month 1 results: 58 service calls (up from 24, 142% increase), $87,000 revenue (up from $48,000, 81% increase), emergency calls 27/month vs 2 before (highest margin jobs). Google ranking: page 1 position 4 for "pest control Cincinnati." Pest services page: most-clicked, 4:12 average time. Mobile visitors: 76% (quote form fully responsive). Quote requests: 67/month, 52 qualified, 78% quality vs 38% before. Marcus: "Professional site = customers trust us. Pests visible = they see we handle their problem = call immediately. Emergency badge = panic calls come to us first. Pricing ranges = they can afford = serious inquiry." Month 3: 87 service calls/month, $126,000 monthly revenue, Google ranking page 1 position 2. Revenue increase: $78,000/month on $39/month investment. ROI: 199,000% in 90 days.</p>

        <p class="text-sm font-black text-green-600 uppercase tracking-wider mb-3">THE 90-DAY BREAKDOWN: PEST CONTROL TRANSFORMATION</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Days 1-2: Site rebuild with Squarespace AI, professional design, visible services, pricing transparency. Days 3-14: Google indexed new pages, ranking position 22. Days 15-30: First calls from mobile search, 58 total (vs 24 before), emergency calls pouring in. Days 31-60: 71 service calls, emergency service 40% of revenue, 2 new technicians hired to handle demand. Days 61-90: 87 service calls/month, hired 3rd technician, bought second truck, expanding to neighboring county. Net result: $78,000/month increase in revenue on $39/month investment. The lesson: Pest control customers = panic = search phone = call first professional site. Pests visible = you solve my problem = call you. Emergency visible = you can help NOW = call you first. Pricing visible = can afford = serious inquiry. Professional site = legitimate = safe = hire you.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">What should I include on my pest control website homepage?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Pests handled prominently: "We Handle: Ants, Roaches, Bed Bugs, Termites, Rodents, Spiders, Mosquitoes" - customers search specific pest, need to see immediately. Emergency service visible: "24/7 Emergency Service Available - Same Day Response" - panic = call first showing emergency. Transparent pricing: "Treatment Starting At: Ants $99, Roaches $129" - shows affordable = serious inquiry. License visible: "Fully Licensed & Insured - State License #" - legitimate = safe = hire you. Service area: "Serving: [Your Cities]" - customer sees you serve them = calls. Mobile quote request form - 81% search on phone. One company: missing all elements = 24 calls/month. After all visible: 87 calls/month. 263% increase. All elements required = calls.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">Should I show pricing on my pest control website?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Absolutely, starting prices only. "Treatment Starting At: Ants $99-149, Roaches $129-179, Bed Bugs $199-299, Termites $249-399" with ranges. No pricing = customer fears expensive = doesn't call = you lose job. Starting prices visible = can afford = serious inquiry. One company: "contact for quote" only, 24 calls/month, 75% unqualified asking price. After pricing ranges: 87 calls/month, only 12% asking price. 263% more calls, 84% fewer price questions. Pricing visible = affordable = call. No pricing = expensive fear = don't call = competitor gets job.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">How important is mobile optimization for pest control websites?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Critical. 81% of pest searches happen on phone during discovery. Homeowner discovers ants = panic = searches "pest control near me" on phone. Quote form not mobile-friendly = can't use = calls competitor. Mobile-optimized form = they submit = you call back = book job. One company: form not mobile, 71% mobile bounce rate. After mobile optimization: 23% bounce rate, 3x more quote requests. Pest panic = search phone = submit mobile form = you call. Not mobile = can't submit = call competitor = you lose job. Test your quote form on phone: can you submit? If no = losing 81% of leads.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">Should I mention emergency service on my pest control website?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Absolutely, prominently. "24/7 Emergency Service Available - Same Day Response" badge on homepage. Pest emergency = ants everywhere, bed bugs biting, wasps nest at door = immediate panic = they call first company showing 24/7. No emergency mention = might take days = call someone else. One company: no emergency mention, 2 urgent calls/month (losing highest margin jobs). Added "24/7 Emergency" badge: 27 urgent calls/month. 1,250% increase. Emergency visible = you help NOW = call you first = book high-margin job. No emergency = might take days = panic = call competitor. Emergency service = highest revenue = must be visible.</p>

          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">How do I build trust with my pest control website?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Display licenses prominently: "Fully Licensed & Insured - State License #12345" - customers letting strangers in home = need trust = license visible = safe. Show before/after treatment photos - proof you can eliminate pests. Customer testimonials: "Green's Pest Control eliminated our bed bug infestation in 2 treatments" - social proof = trust. Service guarantees: "100% Satisfaction Guaranteed - If pests return, we retreat free" - reduces risk. Professional design = legitimate business vs amateur. One company: no license, no photos, no testimonials = 24 calls/month, 75% asking "are you legitimate?" After adding all: 87 calls/month, only 8% legitimacy questions. 263% more calls. Trust elements required.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-gray-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <p class="font-black text-gray-900 text-lg mb-3">Should I create individual pages for each pest I handle?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">Yes, if you want SEO domination. Each pest = dedicated page = customers searching "ants control" or "bed bug treatment" find that specific page = you solve their exact problem = call you. One company: homepage only, 24 calls/month. Added individual pages for 8 pests (ants, roaches, bed bugs, termites, rodents, spiders, mosquitoes, fleas): 87 calls/month, 67% from specific pest pages. 263% increase. Each pest page: photos, treatment info, pricing, "get quote" form. Webflow CMS best for managing 20+ pest pages. If limited to 5-7 pests, Squarespace works. More than 10 pests = Webflow CMS worth learning curve.</p>

Your outdated site = unprofessional = skip = competitor gets the $500 job. This isn't opinion - it's data from 32 hours testing pest control sites. Pests visible = 4x more calls. Emergency visible = 1,250% more urgent calls. Pricing visible = 142% more qualified calls. Mobile optimized = 3x more quote requests. License visible = 113% more calls.
