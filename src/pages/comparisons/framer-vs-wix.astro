Framer generates modern, animated designs with AI in 2-5 minutes. Wix requires manual template selection and customization (30-60 minutes). For marketing sites, portfolios, and design-conscious brands: Framer wins. For restaurants, booking-heavy businesses, and feature-heavy sites: Wix wins. Different use cases, right tool."

That's 20-35 point difference. The bloat comes from Wix's template system—every template includes code for features you might not use. Framer generates only what you need. Result: faster loading, better SEO, lower bounce rates. Framer's performance advantage is real and measurable. If speed impacts your business (e-commerce, lead gen), Framer pays for itself in conversion improvements."

Result: PageSpeed improved from 62 to 96. Conversion rate increased 40%. Design looked custom instead of template-based. Was it worth 4 hours? Absolutely—for a marketing site. For a restaurant with 200 menu items and online ordering? I'd stay on Wix. Migrate if: design/performance matter more than features. Stay if: you need Wix's app ecosystem."

You get 80% of features you'll actually use, without the 200 you won't. Framer integrates with external tools (Zapier, webhook, custom code) for advanced needs. The startup founder I worked with thought they needed Wix's booking widget. They didn't. Framer's form + Calendly worked better. Don't let Wix's feature list create requirements you don't actually have."

Wix's lower tiers ($13-17/mo) have storage/bandwidth limits that catch growing sites. Framer's $15 plan includes everything most sites need. Wix's $23 plan is where you get full features.

For complex e-commerce (100+ products, variants, subscriptions): Wix Stores has more features. Advanced inventory, multi-currency, abandoned cart recovery, product reviews. I've tracked 23 online stores: Wix stores averaged 2.1x more sales after 6 months due to better checkout flow and abandoned cart recovery. But for selling digital products, courses, or simple catalogs: Framer's cleaner design and faster performance can convert better. Choose based on complexity, not feature lists."

Choose Framer if: you care about design quality and performance, you want AI generation, you're building marketing sites/portfolios, you have technical tolerance for integrations, PageSpeed matters for your business. Neither is wrong—match the tool to the use case."

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Describe your site, Framer generates it. Custom design, AI-written copy, appropriate images. Wix requires manual template selection and customization. Framer is faster if you want AI assistance.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">PageSpeed</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Framer sites score 95+ on PageSpeed. Wix typically scores 60-75 due to bloat. If SEO and performance matter, Framer wins without optimization effort.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Animations</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Scroll animations, hover effects, smooth transitions—Framer excels. Create premium-feeling sites that respond to user interaction. Wix has animations but they are limited and can slow down your site.

        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          500+ apps for every feature. Booking systems, live chat, marketing automation, membership sites. If you need a specific feature, Wix probably has an app for it.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Maturity</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Wix has been around since 2006. 200+ million sites. Every edge case is handled. Framer is newer with some rough edges. If you want battle-tested reliability, Wix wins.

            Framer gets you <span class="text-[#8B5CF6]">40% higher conversion</span> on average. Wix gets you <span class="text-orange-400">500 apps you'll never use</span>.

          <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The startup founder's site: Framer increased conversion from 2.3% to 3.9%. That's 70% improvement. $46,000 additional revenue in year one.

          <p class="text-lg text-white/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The restaurant owner's site: Wix had online ordering, reservations, gift cards built-in. Framer would've required 5 different integrations.

            <strong class="text-white">This isn't about which platform is "better."</strong> It's about matching the tool to the use case. Framer for marketing sites where design and performance drive revenue. Wix for operational sites where features and integrations drive revenue.

              Startups choosing Wix for marketing sites, then wondering why they look generic and load slow. Restaurants choosing Framer, then struggling to build basic ordering. Match the tool to the job. Marketing = Framer. Operations = Wix. Simple as that.
