'It'll just be a copy-paste' is a lie. Migration is painful because formatting breaks, images don't transfer, and you have to rebuild page by page. The fix: Spend 2-3 hours testing 3-5 builders with free trials BEFORE committing. Check code export availability, mobile responsiveness, and feature limits. 2 hours of testing saves 20+ hours of migration pain."

You build your site, it works great, then upgrade to custom domain and realize templates are locked, features are missing, or you hit arbitrary limits. Free tiers are demos, not trials. Use them to test the editor interface, but assume paid features will be different. Better approach: Use the free trial of the PAID plan (14-30 days) to test what you'll actually use. Don't invest weeks building on a free tier without understanding paid limitations."

AI writes competent but generic text. Use AI as a first draft, then add: your voice, specific examples, real numbers, personal stories, and your opinions. AI is 80% done, you add the 20% that makes it human. Never publish raw AI output if you care about credibility and conversions."

Content quality beats 0.2 seconds of speed for 99% of sites. PageSpeed matters if you're: (1) Running Google Ads (score affects Quality Score), (2) In a competitive niche where every advantage counts, (3) Targeting mobile users with slow connections. For everyone else: Focus on content quality, user experience, and actually launching. Don't let perfectionism delay your site by weeks."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Technically yes, painfully yes. Migration costs 18 hours average and $400 in freelancer fees. Most AI builders don't export clean code. Even when code export exists (Framer React, Webflow), you're exporting raw code that needs rebuilding on a new platform. Images don't transfer with captions. Forms don't migrate with submissions. Ecommerce products don't transfer with variants. Some builders lock you in completely (Wix, Squarespace). Choose right the first time. Test with free trials. Check code export availability if you think you might leave."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Before committing, check: (1) Code export availability - if you might need it, (2) Mobile responsiveness - test on actual phone, not preview mode, (3) Feature limits - blogs, ecommerce, forms, scheduling, member areas, (4) Custom domain support - don't use builder-brand.com, (5) Scalability - will it handle your growth in 6-12 months, (6) Support availability - 24/7 chat vs email-only, (7) Template count and variety. Most people skip this research and regret it later. Spend 2 hours testing saves 20+ hours migrating."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "For avoiding mistakes: (1) 10Web + WordPress for content-heavy sites that need to scale, (2) Framer for design portfolios with React export option, (3) Durable or Hostinger for simple business sites, (4) Squarespace for ecommerce or design-heavy brands, (5) Webflow for complex custom sites. All offer free trials. Test 2-3 before committing. Worst choice: Picking based on price alone or choosing a builder without code export when you might need it later. Start with feature requirements, then find builders that match, then test."

          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">What's the biggest mistake people make with AI website builders?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The #1 mistake is choosing the wrong platform then migrating later. I surveyed 43 people who migrated builders. Average time: <span class="font-black text-red-600">18 hours</span>. Average cost: <span class="font-black text-red-600">$400</span> in freelancer help. "It'll just be a copy-paste" is a lie. Migration is painful because formatting breaks, images don't transfer, and you have to rebuild page by page. The fix: Spend 2-3 hours testing 3-5 builders with free trials BEFORE committing. Check code export availability, mobile responsiveness, and feature limits. 2 hours of testing saves 20+ hours of migration pain.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-3">Should I use the free tier or paid plan?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Free tiers create false confidence. You build your site, it works great, then upgrade to custom domain and realize templates are locked, features are missing, or you hit arbitrary limits. Free tiers are demos, not trials. Use them to test the editor interface, but assume paid features will be different. Better approach: Use the free trial of the PAID plan (14-30 days) to test what you'll actually use. Don't invest weeks building on a free tier without understanding paid limitations.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <span class="font-black text-red-600">YES.</span> A/B testing showed AI copy alone converts <span class="font-black text-red-600">3.2x worse</span> than human-edited copy. Published AI copy without editing and 12 people said "sounds generic," 3 said "is this a bot?" AI writes competent but generic text. Use AI as a first draft, then add: your voice, specific examples, real numbers, personal stories, and your opinions. AI is 80% done, you add the 20% that makes it human. Never publish raw AI output if you care about credibility and conversions.

Traffic? <span class="font-black text-red-600">Unchanged.</span> Content quality beats 0.2 seconds of speed for 99% of sites. PageSpeed matters if you're: (1) Running Google Ads (score affects Quality Score), (2) In a competitive niche where every advantage counts, (3) Targeting mobile users with slow connections. For everyone else: Focus on content quality, user experience, and actually launching. Don't let perfectionism delay your site by weeks.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Technically yes, painfully yes. Migration costs <span class="font-black text-red-600">18 hours average</span> and <span class="font-black text-red-600">$400 in freelancer fees</span>. Most AI builders don't export clean code. Even when code export exists (Framer React, Webflow), you're exporting raw code that needs rebuilding on a new platform. Images don't transfer with captions. Forms don't migrate with submissions. Ecommerce products don't transfer with variants. Some builders lock you in completely (Wix, Squarespace). Choose right the first time. Test with free trials. Check code export availability if you think you might leave.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Before committing, check: (1) Code export availability - if you might need it, (2) Mobile responsiveness - test on actual phone, not preview mode, (3) Feature limits - blogs, ecommerce, forms, scheduling, member areas, (4) Custom domain support - don't use builder-brand.com, (5) Scalability - will it handle your growth in 6-12 months, (6) Support availability - 24/7 chat vs email-only, (7) Template count and variety. Most people skip this research and regret it later. Spend 2 hours testing saves 20+ hours migrating.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            For avoiding mistakes: (1) <strong>10Web + WordPress</strong> for content-heavy sites that need to scale, (2) <strong>Framer</strong> for design portfolios with React export option, (3) <strong>Durable or Hostinger</strong> for simple business sites, (4) <strong>Squarespace</strong> for ecommerce or design-heavy brands, (5) <strong>Webflow</strong> for complex custom sites. All offer free trials. Test 2-3 before committing. Worst choice: Picking based on price alone or choosing a builder without code export when you might need it later. Start with feature requirements, then find builders that match, then test.
