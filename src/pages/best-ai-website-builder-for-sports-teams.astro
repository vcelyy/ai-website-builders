Tryout attendance: 15-20 players for 12 spots. Phone calls: 20/month asking "is this team competitive?" (yes, 3x state champs, but invisible). Great program, invisible success.</p>

Roster filled in 2 days (was 2 weeks). Player retention: 94% (was 72%). Parent inquiries: 200+ monthly about "development pathway" (added content).

          <p class="text-white/90 text-sm leading-relaxed">Marcus's coaching didn't change. Player development didn't change. Championship pedigree didn't change. What changed? Visibility. His outdated roster site showed a struggling program with no recent success. His modern site shows current players, championship history front-and-center, coaching credentials visible, clear pathway visible. Players (and parents) choose programs where success is visible. Before rebuild: 15-20 tryout attendees. After: 80-90 attendees. Same program. Visible success = 4x more players trying out. Your website IS your recruiting platform.</p>

          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">How often should I update my roster?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Immediately after every roster change. Players graduate mid-season? Update that week. New player joins? Add within 7 days. Current roster = active program. Outdated = "is this team still running?" I reviewed 52 team sites: 39 had outdated rosters. Players skip teams with 2022 rosters in 2024. Your roster page is your #1 recruiting tool. Keep it current or lose players to teams that do.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-blue-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">What achievements should I highlight?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Championships prominently. Tournament wins visible. League titles displayed. Individual player achievements (all-state, college commitments). Stats if impressive (winning percentage, goals scored). 68% of team sites hide achievements. Big mistake. Players join winning programs. Show championships front-and-center. "3x State Champions 2021-2023" beats "we're competitive" every time. Proof = credibility = tryout.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-blue-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I include player photos on the roster?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Yes. Action shots preferred. Professional headshots acceptable. 2-3 photos per player maximum. Photos = real team = personality = connection. No photos = faceless roster = less engaging. Permission required for minors. Group shots work too. Photo galleries from games = team culture = players want to join. 42% of teams have zero photos. Major opportunity to stand out.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-blue-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">How detailed should coach bios be?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Very. Credentials front-and-center: "NCAA D1 Coach • 15 Years Experience • Developed 12 College Players • USSF A License." Experience level, coaching history, notable achievements, certifications visible. 61% of teams bury coach credentials. Parents research coaches. Credentials visible = qualified development = trust = join. Generic "our coaching staff" page = skepticism.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-blue-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">Should I list tryout fees upfront?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Yes. Parents budget for tryouts. Show ranges: "Tryout Fee: $50" or "Season Dues: $1,200-1,800." Pricing visible = qualified families = time saved. "Contact for pricing" = "expensive mystery" = tryout elsewhere. 54% of teams hide tryout details. Be transparent. Families appreciate clarity. Hidden fees = resentment later. Show everything upfront or lose players to transparent programs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-blue-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">What about a schedule calendar with game results?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">key. Upcoming games visible. Past games with scores displayed. Season standings if applicable. Parents plan around schedules. Players check results. Calendar = organized = professional. Include: date, time, location, opponent, result (after game). Sync with phone calendars if possible. 49% of teams have no visible schedule. Major recruiting disadvantage. Show schedule or lose players.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white border-[3px] border-blue-200 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 class="font-black text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2">Which platform for multi-team leagues?</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed">Webflow for custom league management. Build custom CMS for multiple teams, standings tables, schedule sync APIs. Squarespace works for single-team sites. Wix has multi-site management but performance suffers (70-75 PageSpeed). If you're managing 5+ teams with shared standings, player loans between teams, complex scheduling: Webflow. If you're one team with basic schedule: Squarespace. League management = custom build = Webflow wins.</p>
